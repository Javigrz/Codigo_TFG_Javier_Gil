I think their comment was deleted, but it still made me think about why I think it's not healthy for us.  Disclaimer:  I've been strongly opposed to Justice Thomas since his appointment and his actions in recent years are some of the worst, especially him and his wife's support or non-action on attempts to overthrow the government.

1) If you had a wish, like a real honest-to-goodness wish, would you really spend it on making someone die?  Why not wish for them to have a change of heart or to retire after reevaluating their life or otherwise to come around to a place where they could attone for the things they have done?

2) Consider that there are others making similar wishes but for people that you like or even care about.  This thought sobers me a bit, especially knowing that some of them may take action to make their wishes come true.

3) Death changes the way people think about things.  Some become lionized in death, or their message gets stronger.  Other times, we forget the terrible things they've done and don't fully process the impacts and correct the causes.

I don't want Clarence Thomas to continue as he has been on the supreme court.  I would like to see him replaced.  I'd really like it if the corrupt and treasonous actions he's taken were prosecuted and we as a society prevented them from happening.

Ehhh...

I loathe Thomas just as much as any sane person, but there are countless factors that could make accepting Oliver's offer non-viable.

For one, if Thomas suddenly left the Supreme Court, then almost certainly every bribe and deal he's taken that could be rescinded, would be rescinded.

That means whoever bought his momma's house will probably foreclose or sell off her home.

Any gifts, including that motor home, would be taken back if at all possible.

Thomas would almost certainly receive threats on him and his family's safety. 

Any deals made for future bribes would be nulled immediately.

Basically, Thomas taking Oliver's offer would be like suddenly trying to leave a Gang or step down from being a high-ranking Mob Boss.

He wouldn't be able to just take the offer and get away free & safe, there would most likely be serious repercussions. 

If I was in Thomas' position and had already stooped so low and sold my soul to the Devil, I sure as hell wouldn't be asking the Devil for Taksie-Backsies, either.

This case has elements that a normal case wouldn‚Äôt. The first is one‚Äôs political beliefs or distrust in the government. While jury nullification is prohibited in NY it doesn‚Äôt mean one won‚Äôt vote their conscious. It just takes one person to believe the government is out to get him. The second thing I fear is jury intimidation. Unlike in organized crime cases which requires the mob to dish out retribution for a guilty verdict, Trump literally has millions of whacko‚Äôs and violent followers to carry out intimidation or worse violence without any instructions. Just look at election officials that lives were ruined. Can anyone say they wouldn‚Äôt be afraid of this? Especially knowing Trump and his legal team are going to do everything and anything to expose  the jury regardless if it is legal or not. The third thing is a misdemeanor charge being levied rather than a felony. A juror that is battling with points one and two may feel compelled to go that route. Especially as a felony conviction requires the evidence to show the hush payment was made to defraud the public with election campaign laws. Attorneys could seed doubt that it was for concealing from wife or other reasons. It appears this will be the strategy from what I have read as the evidence of concealment is too great. With the ultimate goal to appeal the verdict of a misdemeanor until the statute of limitations run out. 

Hope I am wrong but I do believe what Trump says, that there is a dual justice system. I just believe it is stacked in his favor not the other way around.",1,1,0,0

Hillary was then investigated by the FBI prior to the election under the Obama administration for her ‚Äòextremely careless‚Äô handling of classified emails through her private email server. 

However, FBI Director Comey chose not to prosecute based on extremely dubious reasoning. So Trump declined to pursue the issue further. He accepted, begrudgingly, the findings of the FBI and retained Comey during his administration.

> Despite not recommending charges be brought against Clinton, Comey delivered a blistering rebuke of her actions, saying the FBI found that 110 emails were sent or received on Clinton's server containing classified information.

> He added it was possible that people hostile to the U.S. had gained access to her personal email account.

> ""Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,"" he said.

> Comey said seven email chains were classified at the ‚ÄúTop Secret/Special Access Program level‚Äù when they were sent and received on Clinton‚Äôs server.

> ‚ÄúThere is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton‚Äôs position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation,‚Äù Comey said.

> Tuesday's decision helps remove what was arguably the biggest threat to her presidential campaign going forward ‚Äì a criminal referral that could have led to an indictment ‚Äì just weeks before her party‚Äôs national convention in Philadelphia, where she is set to seal her nomination as the Democrat standard-bearer.

> Clinton consistently had downplayed the FBI investigation, even calling it a ‚Äúsecurity review,‚Äù and as recently as June 3 said there was ‚Äúabsolutely no possibility‚Äù she‚Äôd be indicted.

Is that the reason...or do they have evidence for those 91 charges? If you think those charges are just amped up with no backing just to create a story, how would you know that?

The fact Trump is so petrified should tell you something. If he was innocent, he could stand his ground. He'd face the trials with the assurance of his innocence...you know, *courageously.*

But you see, he is scared shitless. He is redirecting the whole thing to him being victimized. This is not courageous. A courageous response would be to say ""bring it on"" and then stand your ground with confidence. But he blames everyone else for everything. He attacks the judges, the clerks, their families, even some of the witnesses instead of just proving his innocence in court.

His right to freedom of speech is not being violated. He just won't play the game like the rules dictate probably because he is running scared...or at the very least *appears* to be running scared rather than the strong alpha he pretends to be.

Your ""the whole point"" comment assumes a lot. I'm curious to know how you would come to that conclusion. What inside scoop do you have that would negate all of the charges against him? What about even one of the charges against him?

More from courtroom on the gag order:

> The prosecutors then asked that Trump be fined $1,000 for each of his posts that violate the gag order and that he be warned that if he does it again he will be put in jail. They noted that one of the posts happened while court was going on today.

**UPDATE**

> Judge Merchan will hold a hearing on April 24th about whether Donald Trump violated a gag order and should be fined and held in contempt of court.

(I honestly wonder if this has anything to do with Republican objections to FISA renewal, as that's usually a concern of the left...)

So I don't think there is any way they are going to use the mob to create any legal fictions surrounding the certification. If they want to show up on Jan 6, 2025, every one of them will be matched by five counterprotestors, five cops, three Guardsmen and an FBI agent. They simply cannot muster the amount of people that anti-fascist forces can, or that government agencies can. They had their shot at the January 6 strategy and they blew it.

It's the fact that our would-be brownshirts have a very high rate of motor scooter usage and are liable to taze themselves in the balls to death that makes it pretty hard for me to take them seriously as a threat. Do you think they'd have a prayer in guerilla warfare against the gangs of DC or Chicago (who would probably happy ally with each other against a common threat in such a situation)? Or for that matter, the US military - who are very unlikely to side with MAGA, given the enlisted's demographic composition - mostly young, non-white people - and the Officer Corps's high level of education. Both are groups Trump is terribly unpopular with. (I don't think military personnel like his lack of discipline and honor, either, or his constant threats to deploy them to Iran or wherever else.)

So what I'm talking about is just, once it's clear Trump has lost, and will not be taking power - what will his cult do then? Like the other responder said, there will be individual acts of terrorism, for sure, but there is no short-term existential threat to the US government as long as Donald Trump is not part of it.

If he just straight up wins the election, well, then things will deteriorate. But I don't see that happening. If white supremacists were going to take over this country they should've gone for it in the Reagan era, or immediately following 9/11. They just don't have the numbers anymore.",-1,0,1,0

It makes you inadmissible if the felony you've been charged with (not even convicted, CBSA has no requirement to presume a foreign national innocent before being found guilty in court) is also an indictable offense in Canada, which are the Canadian legal equivalent of a felony. 

And seeing as how most of the major offenses one could commit in the US that would result in a felony charge are also indictable offenses in Canada, most felons are denied entry into the country. And if any of the offenses involve weapons or violence of any kind, that could result in a lifetime prohibition from entry.

Donald Trump has been in court plenty of times in the last few months, but on Monday he became the first American president to stand trial for an alleged criminal offense. Day One of the former president‚Äôs trial on charges related to a 2016 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels kicked off in Manhattan ‚Äî and tensions are already running high.

While the trial will open with what promises to be an intense jury selection process, state prosecutors and Trump‚Äôs attorneys preempted the process by arguing over what evidence will be admissible during the proceedings. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg‚Äòs team also pushed to have Trump held in contempt of the court after allegedly violating a gag order put in place by Judge Juan Merchan.

Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass indicated that the state would submit a request ‚Äúseeking an order to show cause why Defendant should not be held in contempt‚Äù after flaunting an order from the court barring him from attacking witnesses, prosecutors, court staff, and jurors involved in the case. Steinglass argued that ‚Äî among several other instances ‚Äî Trump attacked two key witnesses in the case, Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen, in a Wednesday Truth Social post referring to the pair as ‚Äúsleazebags.‚Äù

EDIT: Specifically in regards to violating gag orders:

*Prosecutors said they want Merchan to punish Trump for violating the judge's gag order by sharing certain social media posts over the weekend.*

*They said they want the judge to sanction Trump for each of three posts, to tell Trump to take down the posts, and to warn him that another post could result in jail time.*'

EDIT 2: Lunch break until 1:30 EST. Plenty of time for a stretch and to get more popcorn.

  
EDIT 3: Some spicy from the judge about evidence inclusion, protection for Juror ID, Trump using delay tactics again.

  
*Todd Blanche, Trump's lawyer, said the defense team doesn't have certain exhibits for the trial because they ""just got"" a raft of documents from the U.S. Attorney's Office a month ago.*

*Joshua Steinglass, one of the DA's prosecutors, countered that Trump's lawyers have buried the court in thousands of pages of frivolous motions.*

*""You have 24 hours,"" Merchan told Trump's defense. ""Whatever you don‚Äôt identify in the next 24 hours, you will be precluded from using.""*

  
...

  
*Trump's lawyer Todd Blanche asked when counsel will get the names of prospective jurors and how.*

*Merchan said that he would be handing the defense team and prosecution one copy of juror names and one copy of juror numbers.*

*The judge made clear that the list with the names cannot be copied or photographed and must be returned to the court.*  
...

*Trump is asking Judge Aileen Cannon, who is overseeing the Florida case, to push back the current May 9 deadline for his disclosure of expert witnesses and a submission to the Justice Department on what classified information he intends to use during the trial until three weeks after the end of his New York trial.*

*Blanche and another Trump lawyer, Emil Bove, are also representing him in the New York trial and would also be unable to travel to Florida, they said. And Kise can‚Äôt pick up the slack because he will be unavailable due to a planned medical procedure, they said.*

*‚ÄúPresident Trump made these decisions about the composition of his defense team in both cases at a time when there were no scheduling conflicts,‚Äù Blanche and Kise wrote. ‚ÄúNeither President Trump nor his counsel can be in both places at once.‚Äù*¬†

*The special counsel‚Äôs office responded yesterday, urging Cannon to reject Trump‚Äôs request.*¬†

*‚ÄúAlthough the defendants‚Äô motion reads as though the Court were unaware of Trump‚Äôs other case, and as if the defendants had no forewarning that a Section 5 deadline would be set, those premises are plainly wrong,‚Äù counselor to the special counsel Jay Bratt wrote. ‚ÄúThe defendants have had ample notice that these deadlines would be scheduled and have already had months to complete the work.""*¬†

*‚ÄúEach time the Court sets a new deadline in this case and attempts to keep it moving toward trial, the defendants reflexively ask for an adjournment,‚Äù Bratt concluded. ‚ÄúThat must stop.‚Äù*",-1,0,1,0

Maybe there's $80 million of debt obligations out there against it.  Which now means you are underwater $5 million.  That's bad.

1c4hrwt,ShySpecter23,1713190891.0,"The problem with polling data this far out in an election year is the constantly changing political landscape that influences these polls. You'll hear about how poor Biden is handling the Israel/Palestine - possibly Iran - conflict and all of a sudden his polling tanks due to perceived protest voters and fear of international war with America dragged in. All of a sudden, you hear Arizona stole women's right to their bodily autonomy and the fear of abortion restrictions are driving up Biden's polling numbers from women afraid of losing more of their rights.

Ultimately, with how our political landscape is today, a lot of these polls are being driven by fear. Fear over the economy, fear over immigration, fear from international conflict, fear of a woman's free autonomy, fear for LGBTQ+ communities, and fear of American involvement into another war. Every time some big issue occurs, polling data changes with it. I wouldn't be surprised if I see articles coming out later this week showing Biden is losing support from his base over the mishandling of America's response to the Iranian missiles launched over the weekend (assuming he handles the situation poorly) and polls shows he lost support - again.

Polls have less variance when we get closer to election as most of the big scary issues have already happened and it's unlikely a new one pops up a week or two before an election that sways someones mind that drastically.

1c4hrwt,SerfTint,1713200887.0,"I recognize that your post is sarcastic.  But people gravely misunderstand the mindset of today's Republican voter.  Most aren't really Republicans, they're Trumplicans.  So when we point to 2018 and 2022, those are not accurate indications.  The Republican Party is struggling, because the majority of the country is vaguely Liberal or Leftist, and even most Republicans are disgusted by their party.  But they WILL come out for Trump.  In 2016 and in 2020, Trump significantly OVERPERFORMED his polling, while the rest of the party largely does not.  

So I don't think there'll be a giant red wave in 2024, though it is certainly very possible, maybe even 50/50 that Republicans narrowly take the Senate and narrowly hold the House.  But Trump himself is a gigantic favorite to win in November.

Biden had a 52% approval rating on Election Day 2020, and just barely won (it took 4 days to even make sure he had won).  He has a 39% approval rating right now, 3 points lower than Trump's is.  Trump had a 37% approval rating on Election Day 2016 and won, and now it is 42%, and Biden's is currently lower than Hillary's was.

1c4j8dk,ShySpecter23,1713192526.0,"To be fair, their are many culprits guilty of stealing women's right to their bodily autonomy that aren't just Trump. The federalist society has spent decades influencing local - state - and federal elections to increase the amount of religious fundamentalist conservatives in our political network. They also played a large role in multiple presidential administrations in personally handpicking these extreme conservative courts, including helping Trump decide on new Supreme court justices that will impact the supreme court for decades to come.

Another guilty culprit is of course the democratic party. As a dem myself, their have been many years where we had a majority in both the house and senate but never passed legislation to codify it into law. This is because we have to understand how both parties make their money.

Republicans get more money from single donors - aka the rich because they will offer tax cuts. Dems - who historically favor higher taxes on the rich - have a track record of receiving more money through a wider range of donors than a single one. As a result, dems fear-monger issues without actually solving them. Roe was also a carrot on a stick for dems.

Lastly, of course is Trump and his base. He is crazy enough to say the quiet part out loud and because of that he became the voice for the worst people on the planet. He essentially embolden and empowered these people because he was saying their vile thoughts but on the world stage - even as president. These people who were slowly become silent on the issue had their voice restored under Trump and feel they need to exercise that voice and shove it down everyone's throat because Trump has convinced them the entire world is against them.

This isn't to say Trump isn't at fault here, but lets be clear. This is like the Nazi regime in the sense that Hitler himself wasn't the scariest aspect of the Nazis.

Both of these things are true, and there's a discussion to be had there.

  
But if Roe was a shaky tower that one side was trying to topple and the other refused to replace with something sturdier, when the person trying to topple it succeeds, no amount of ""why didn't they replace it?"" changes the fact that it would still be standing in all it's glorious structural instability if not for your success at pushing it over.",0,0,0,1

It's not as if he doesn't care and thus his ambivalence got in the way and less was accomplished. Because he doesn't care and like you said, just wants the power republicans afford him, he is going to be drug to their position regardless of what he may truly believe in his barely functioning brain. It's not as if that because he's almost certainly paid for an abortion or two that he slowed the Republicans down or defended abortion rights in any tangible and meaningful way. Mike Pence (who has been having a kayfabe fight with Trump over abortion in the last week) cared about abortion, Trump almost certainly didn't, but the results of a Trump presidency were in line with what Pence wants in regards to abortion.

Trump is the republican party and the republican party is Trump. Where the larger party cares about something and he doesn't, they drag him to their position. Where he cares about something and the larger republican party doesn't, he drags them to his position. It's the worst of both world's.

>As a business, Trump Media has largely underwhelmed: The company lost $58 million last year on $4 million in revenue, less than the average Chick-fil-A franchise, **even as it paid out millions in executive salaries, bonuses and stock.** ...

>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not another company out there that has retail investors like this,‚Äù said Nunes, who this year will receive a $1 million salary, a $600,000 retention bonus and a stock package currently worth $3.7 million. ...

>Many of Truth Social‚Äôs investors say they‚Äôre in it for the long haul. Todd Schlanger, an interior designer at a furniture store in West Palm Beach who said Trump had been one of his customers, said he‚Äôs invested about $20,000 in total and is buying new shares every week.

>Schlanger said he now watches his stock performance every day hoping for positive signs. In a Truth Social post last week, he encouraged ‚Äúeveryone who supports Donald Trump and Truth [Social to] buy a share everyday‚Äù and asked, ‚ÄúDo you think we have hit bottom?‚Äù (The stock slid nearly 10 percent after that post.)

>**He suspects the recent drops in share price have been the result of ‚Äústock manipulation‚Äù from an ‚Äúorganized effort‚Äù to make the company look bad.** There‚Äôs no proof of such a campaign, but Schlanger is convinced. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs got to be political,‚Äù he said, from all the **‚Äúliberals that are trying to knock it down.‚Äù** ...

>Some accounts there have recently encouraged traders to keep investing in a fight they said was about **‚Äúgood vs evil‚Äù ‚Äî a way to defend Trump from the liberal elites laughing at him** and, by extension, them. The user @BaldylocksUSMC said ‚Äúthe fight has been long and hard on most of us‚Äù and that ‚Äúthis stock is not for the weak,‚Äù but that one day they would triumph over critics who were ‚Äúbrainwashed beyond repair.‚Äù ...

>‚ÄúIf I lose it, fine. If I make a profit, wonderful. But at the end of the day, I wanted to show my support,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs such an effort to destroy him and strip his wealth away, and so much glee about it. I would like to see him be a winner.‚Äù ...

>McLain, the tree service owner in Oklahoma, said he believes the stock could ‚Äúgo to $1,000 a share, easy,‚Äù once the media stops writing so negatively about it and the company works through its growing pains. The company‚Äôs leaders, he said, are being ‚Äútoo silent right now‚Äù amid questions about the falling share price, but he suspects it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre working on something amazing and new.

>McLain is an amateur trader ‚Äî he invested only once before and ‚Äúlost [his] butt‚Äù ‚Äî and said he hasn‚Äôt talked to his family about his investment, saying, ‚ÄúYou know how that is.‚Äù But he believes the Trump Media deal is a sign he is ‚Äúsupposed to invest,‚Äù he said.

>‚Äú**This isn‚Äôt just another stock to me. ‚Ä¶ I feel like it was God Almighty that put it in my lap**,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve just got to hold on and let them do their job. If you go on emotion, you‚Äôll get out of this thing the first time it goes down.‚Äù

It's another thing entirely to invest in his company and expect a good return on your money because he's such a rich and successful businessman. These stock buyers may have been hesitant to donate more to their savior since they don't profit from it directly but have jumped at the chance to buy stock because they see it as a win/win. Now it's a lose/win situation that they might not be able to afford.

This stock should have crashed and burned based on the fundmentals never mind the lawsuits. Yet everyday big buys happen at inflated prices to stabilize the fall.

Quick edit: I just skimmed the latest S1 filing. If I wasn‚Äôt already against the stock I‚Äôd sure be after reading just the risks section. Key things of note:

1 They call out that they have never relied on industry accepted metrics to operate their business and have no plans to do so. Key things such as ‚Äúactive number of daily users.‚Äù For a media/entertainment platform to ignore DAU is insane. They even state they‚Äôre just too strategic and early days to pay attention to those numbers. Yet are a public company. 

2 they blame everyone but themselves if killing cookies causes their ad business to crumble. They even blame users for rejecting their cookies. The bigger issue here is its well known (for years) that every major browser (including chrome) have been on a path to reduce/eliminate cookies. To call this out as if it‚Äôs new and be a tech company is also insane. 

3 They call out that they might be called out for violating various laws in regards to security and privacy. Going so far as to say that adhering to these laws might be hard and complex for them so if they violate them oh well. Again this is a known thing in the tech industry. Privacy laws, whether in the us or otherwise, are all known. You don‚Äôt go into this industry without the means to adhere as nearly every tool out there can assist or there are services which will help you out with compliance. 

4 they call out users engaging and generating useful content. So if users don‚Äôt make us succeed they‚Äôre to blame. 

5 they call out their own financial statements already released as suspect and a risk. Why would you invest in this?

>[How Trump Steered Supporters Into Unwitting Donations](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/us/politics/trump-donations.html)

>Online donors were guided into weekly recurring contributions. Demands for refunds spiked. Complaints to banks and credit card companies soared. But the money helped keep Donald Trump‚Äôs struggling campaign afloat.

>Stacy Blatt was in hospice care last September listening to Rush Limbaugh‚Äôs dire warnings about how badly Donald J. Trump‚Äôs campaign needed money when he went online and chipped in everything he could: $500.

>It was a big sum for a 63-year-old battling cancer and living in Kansas City on less than $1,000 per month. But that single contribution ‚Äî federal records show it was his first ever ‚Äî quickly multiplied. Another $500 was withdrawn the next day, then $500 the next week and every week through mid-October, without his knowledge ‚Äî until Mr. Blatt‚Äôs bank account had been depleted and frozen. When his utility and rent payments bounced, he called his brother, Russell, for help.

>What the Blatts soon discovered was $3,000 in withdrawals by the Trump campaign in less than 30 days. They called their bank and said they thought they were victims of fraud.

>‚ÄúIt felt,‚Äù Russell said, ‚Äúlike it was a scam.‚Äù 

>But what the Blatts believed was duplicity was actually an intentional scheme to boost revenues by the Trump campaign and the for-profit company that processed its online donations, WinRed. Facing a cash crunch and getting badly outspent by the Democrats, the campaign had begun last September to set up recurring donations by default for online donors, for every week until the election. ...

>But for some Trump supporters like Ron Wilson, WinRed is a scam artist. Mr. Wilson, an 87-year-old retiree in Illinois, made a series of small contributions last fall that he thought would add up to about $200; by December, federal records show, WinRed and Mr. Trump‚Äôs committees had withdrawn more than 70 separate donations from Mr. Wilson worth roughly $2,300.

>‚ÄúPredatory!‚Äù Mr. Wilson said of WinRed. Like multiple other donors interviewed, though, he held Mr. Trump himself blameless, telling The Times, **‚ÄúI‚Äôm 100 percent loyal to Donald Trump.‚Äù**",1,1,0,0

Just making space for the Secret Service to set up alone I imagine is difficult since there aren't a lot of prisons that aren't already overflowing and someone like Trump would need to spend his entire time there in isolation to protect him. Logistically it's an easy thing to see a judge agreeing to house arrest over. 

I don't know why you think it's easier. Prisons are very complicated as is the protection needed for a former or existing Presidents. It's also very dangerous and rife for problems to happen when Secret Service doesn't have the access they want. Prison officials would absolutely hate allowing Secret Service with their own needs and demands into the middle of their prions that are already difficult to control. 

It would be beyond the pal easier to defend someone if they are never allowed to leave their already fortified home. If he's placed under house arrest no one has to do anything differently and the government doesn't have to spend millions trying to deal with him from prison.

Because he's a former President (this matters) if it were a single charge I'd prefer he not be charged. With 34 of them I would find it ridiculous to not have them be felonies, not get first time offender status (he's going to earn a bunch of contempt of courts too).

Your examples I think make the case that none of these laws are going to be applied to him in the same way they would me or you.

1c4m3qq,Johnhaven,1713200099.0,">blows my mind that you think house arrest would be easier for secret service than a prison

1. The Secret Service can customize and reinforce a home much easier than a prison and there is more room for them to run a facility to protect him. It's not just two guards standing outside his door. 
2. The prison system is not going to want someone in prison who has custom security and will need to customize parts of their jail. This is also expensive.
3. In prison you're locked in with criminals and any number of bad things can happen. It's easier to keep people out than to stay away from people already in your house.

You put far too much faith in bars and have little care for the administrative cost or hassle and the fact that no one would have any idea how to do this and would need to make it up as they go. It's like you've never heard of house arrest before they do it all the time when it's possible and it's more possible here than any other time ever since there will be a team of government agents around him at all times so it's hard for him to run away. 

>prison officials will not be blocking the ss... the ss is effectively serving as a staff aug and this helps them. if not, they dont have much say regardless. this [would.be](http://would.be) a problem for the prison system not SS

The SS would require a bunch of room, to be able to customize parts of the prison, and to have their own security rules and regulations beyond that of the prison system. This is far more complicated than you seem to think it is. It is apparent though that I'm the first one you've run into saying this because this is obvious to a lot of people. 

>i believe you are patently wrong about it being easier to defend someone in the public.

Not in public, house arrest. In a house that is already customized, secured, and with plenty of room for SS operations from when he was President and continuing now. 

Again, this would interfere with prison operations and the DOC would fight back against it they don't like exceptions because exceptions are how people escape. 

Now though, let me point out that the crime he has been charged with is a misdemeanor by itself. It's risen to a felony level because of the number of counts. Still, putting someone in prison for a crime that straddles the limit between misdemeanor and felony is touchy at best. A felony requires a year in prison but I'd be surprised to see much in terms of incarceration let alone a former President. The other cases are a different story though.   
  
 Additionally this is the former President and it just looks bad. I know a lot of people want to hope that Trump is subject to the same laws we are but that's just not true. No one else in this nation can get SCOTUS to consider the question of, ""is he immune from all crimes just because he used to be president?"" What the hell do you think would happen to either of us if we asked something so obviously bizarre? Even if Trump weren't President we'd be having this conversation but because he was President I don't think he would see the inside of a prison no matter what crimes he committed except maybe capital crimes. 

There's a lot more to the consideration of putting Trump into a prison than I'm coming up with off the top of my head too. It sets a bad precedent and it would actually improve our relations with allies showing that we also didn't find him acceptable but the conviction would do that anyway.

I hope you know this, but ...that's not how that works.   

I feel like Reddit has this collective method setting expectations at an unrealistic level, and then complaining that trump gets special treatment when the expectations aren't met.   (nb: i'm not saying he hasn't gotten special treatment, but the expectations here are also unrealistic)

Even if the bond is vacated and she's given the go ahead to start proceedings to executing the judgment, the collection process is still legalistic and will take months.  

If the bond is revoked,  he owes the judgment while the appeal is pending.  While this isn't common, it's not unheard of for the judgment to be paid into escrow pending the outcome of an appeal.  For the sake of appearances, she would likely have to make a formal demand to pay the judgment voluntarily, give him a deadline, and let the deadline elapse. 

Then she would have to identify as specific property or set of properties, and file a petition for a writ of execution, permitting her to begin seizure proceedings on those properties. 

If it were personal property or bank accounts, the writ of execution would be sufficient to seize the property and/or garnish the accounts. She may well do that in some cases. 

However, if the property is real estate, that's tantamount to a foreclosure.  The court would have to grant the writ of execution, and then begin separate proceedings to hold a public auction of the property with 30-45 days notice.    They'd have to go through the formality of publishing a notice in the paper or posting it on a bulletin board.  There'd be a public auction (unless there were a short sale or some other judicial proceedings halted the sale - for example a petition by a lienholder or other investor in the property)  

If the foreclosure sale did go, then it would be up to the purchasor to decide whether or not or how to evict trump.",1,1,0,0

> The indictment charged Trump with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, in violation of New York Penal Law ¬ß175.10. Each count is related to a specific business document, each having a date ranging from February 14 through December 5, 2017:¬†


> 11 for invoices from Michael Cohen¬†¬†


>¬†9 for general ledger entries for Donald J. Trump¬†


> 3 for general ledger entries for the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust


> 8 for checks from Donald J. Trump


> 2 for checks from the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust¬†


> The allegedly falsified documents are related to Trump's payment to Stormy Daniels as hush money. The payments were listed in the business records as a legal expense payable to Michael Cohen, whereas the indictment alleges that they were actually to reimburse Cohen for the earlier, allegedly illicit, payment to Daniels.


> Falsifying business records in the first degree is a felony under New York state law that requires that the ""intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof"". This is in contrast to falsifying business records in the second degree, which is a misdemeanor that does not have that requirement. In later filings, Bragg listed three such crimes that Trump allegedly intended to commit: violation of federal campaign finance limits, violation of state election laws by unlawfully influencing the 2016 election, and violation of state tax laws regarding the reimbursement.Trump can move to allow the jury the option to convict on the misdemeanor charges as a lesser included offense, but is not required to do so.¬†

If none can be achieved, eventually a mistrial (called a ""Hung jury"") is declared.  It means the prosecutor gets another chance to try the case, but otherwise the defendant is free to go, neither convicted nor exonerated.

Only 5-7% of trials end with a hung jury, to be clear.  In a normal case, the evidence is usually either overwhelming, or it isn't.  If it is, it's not hard to get 12 ""guilties"".  If it isn't, it should not be hard to get 12 ""not guilties"" (though it happens).  [Here's some info](https://thedefenders.net/blogs/hung-jury/#:~:text=If%20some%20jurors%20believe%20that,struggle%20to%20reach%20a%20consensus.) about hung juries and why/when they happen.

Leaving Trump out of my mind for a moment here..  Hung Juries are one of the things I consider to be a failing of our justice system.  A single ""not guilty"" vote by a reasonable juror is usually concrete evidence of reasonable doubt.  So knowing that the most common outcome of a hung jury mistrial is to retry, it reiterates a concern I have in general that we in the US don't really follow the reasonable doubt standard we claim.

Trump is all bluster when the cameras are on him, but as he's done in other cases and depositions, he's relatively tame when in court when there are no cameras (not all the time obviously but most of the time).  I suspect his lawyers have drilled in to his addled brain that since this is a criminal trial that the moment he steps into the courtroom he needs to stfu, but outside they allow him to be the blowhard he wants to be.  

He doesn't care about disrespecting the court in civil trials, it's just money and usually not his, that he has to pay with, but in a criminal trial he faces being locked up, and while he claims he wants it, that's just him acting tough, he's scared shitless of that because he'd no longer get media attention for what he says.",-1,0,1,0

1c4oiuq,SockofBadKarma,1713196781.0,"Addendum on this for people who aren't lawyers or otherwise well-versed in evidentiary procedure:

Character evidence to suggest that a person must have committed a crime because they are a bad person is not allowed *by itself.* You can't say, for instance, ""This person accused of murder is definitely guilty because his wife says he beats her and his neighbor says he kills cats.""

But that's *only* if the defendant doesn't try to *disprove* a case on the basis of redeeming character evidence. Should the defendant make the nature of their character a controversy in legal proceedings, *then* the prosecutor can come in with contrary character evidence to dispute the defendant's claims.

Good defense lawyers will know this and prevent a scumbag client from ever trying to claim they're not a scumbag, relying instead on the weight of the other evidence and arguing from a legal perspective that the government has not proven its case. But Trump does not have good defense lawyers and is a textbook narcissist, so you can quite plausibly expect in coming days for him or his attorneys to try to argue that he's a very good, awesome, super cool person who everybody loves and this is just a Democrat witch hunt and everyone adores him and he would never do anything like this because of how morally praiseworthy he is.

We're gonna get sucked into the megathread aren't we?

We don't get to see what's in the box.

>The defense has asked for at least nine more weeks of delay, noting that Trump is scheduled to go on trial in New York starting on Monday and continuing for at least six weeks. The defense claimed to need three weeks of time after the first Trump trial ends before responding to the Mar-a-Lago deadlines.

>‚ÄúAs explained below, the May 9 deadlines would deny President Trump his constitutional right to participate in critical aspects of his defense, and infringe on his constitutional right to counsel of his choice in this case,‚Äù the Trump filing said, arguing that the defendant and his lawyers Christopher Kise and Todd Blanche simply do not have the time to juggle both cases.

Skill issue, they said it not me.

>‚ÄúThe May 9 deadlines,‚Äù the defense added, ‚Äúwill require lengthy classified submissions and extensive time in a SCIF to prepare and discuss those submissions, which is time President Trump and his attorneys simply do not have during the trial that is about to begin in New York.‚Äù

What do you mean no megathread? 

>Special counsel Smith responded on Sunday that the defense has already gotten half a year of additional time to file on these two issues but are acting as if the deadlines snuck up on them without notice.

>‚ÄúThis Court set the May 9 deadline fully apprised of defendant Trump‚Äôs New York trial. Although the defendants‚Äô motion reads as though the Court were unaware of Trump‚Äôs other case, and as if the defendants had no forewarning that a Section 5 deadline would be set, those premises are plainly wrong,‚Äù the government said. ‚ÄúThe defendants have had ample notice that these deadlines would be scheduled and have already had months to complete the work.‚Äù

Jack Smith said ""Skill issue"".

>Smith, reminding the defense that Trump does have local counsel ‚Äúwho have obtained all the necessary security clearances‚Äù and who should be able to meet the deadlines, asserted that the former president and his lawyers Kise and Blanche should not be permitted to achieve further ‚Äúopen-ended‚Äù delay based on having to fight multiple criminal cases simultaneously. In essence, the special counsel argued that Trump should not be rewarded for choosing the same lawyers to defend him in the Mar-a-Lago and New York criminal cases.

Cannon might reward Trump for this, but that's cause she needs more time to read up on her law school notes, lest Jack Smith take her to school again.

>‚ÄúCounsel should already be prepared to meet these deadlines, and in any event, other commitments are not grounds for postponement. Trump elected to engage the same counsel of record in multiple serious criminal matters, and his counsel agreed to the multiple engagements,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúHaving made such decisions, they should not be allowed to use their overlapping engagements to perpetually delay trial in this case. Not to mention, the defendants have capable local counsel who can contribute to the work. The Court should reject the defendants‚Äô latest delay tactic and maintain the established deadline.‚Äù

So things look bad and your back's against the wall/Your whole existence seems fucking hopeless

You're feeling filthy as a dive bar bathroom stall/Can't face the world sober and dopeless

You've lost your way/You think your life is wrecked

[Well, let me just say you're correct üéµ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_OVd1Ao7M) Wait, what?

>Smith emphasized the ‚Äúimportance‚Äù of the ‚Äúcrucial‚Äù CIPA ¬ß 5(a) Notice in ‚Äúgetting the case to trial.‚Äù The section exists for the defense to reveal whether it ‚Äúreasonably expects to disclose or to cause the disclosure of classified information in any manner in connection with any trial or pretrial proceeding involving the criminal prosecution of such defendant.‚Äù

>‚ÄúIf the defendant fails to comply with the requirements of subsection (a) the court may preclude disclosure of any classified information not made the subject of notification and may prohibit the examination by the defendant of any witness with respect to any such information,‚Äù the statute says.

Cannon can't let that happen so she's probably going togive Trump what he wants, more delays. 

>The special counsel said the Trump defense team has the classified discovery it needs ‚Äî and has had ‚Äúnearly all‚Äù of it since November ‚Äî in order to file the notice. Smith urged Cannon to reject the defense arguments as she did before.

That means that Trumps team has likely talked him out of sharing it on Truth Social. Aww man I wanted to know what Emmanual Macrons sex life was like, I thought The Don would be the one guy I could trust to spill that tea to everyone. 

>‚ÄúTheir motion is therefore tantamount to a motion for reconsideration, which should be denied. The procedural history alone is sufficient grounds for denial. Defendants have known since this case was charged that they would need to file a CIPA Section 5 notice. As of November 2, 2023, they had nearly all classified discovery produced to date, an imminent CIPA Section 5 deadline, and an imminent expert witness disclosure deadline. And they have had access to the Government‚Äôs expert disclosures since the beginning of this year,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúIt is true that the defendants must access that submission in a SCIF. But they have already had three months to do so, which is more than adequate time. In fact, the Court‚Äôs July scheduling order set the defense expert disclosure deadline one week after the Government‚Äôs.‚Äù

Judge Cannon set a date near tothe governments wish, she saw this coming. They saw this coming, Smith saw this coming, we all saw this coming. This is a hollow delay tactic, and you can tell it's hollow cause if you knock on that SCIF it rings like a bell.

>The special counsel concluded by slamming the defense for ‚Äúreflexively‚Äù seeking delays whenever Cannon sets another deadline, saying, ‚ÄúThat must stop.‚Äù

>‚ÄúEach time the Court sets a new deadline in this case and attempts to keep it moving toward trial, the defendants reflexively ask for an adjournment. That must stop. The Court should deny defendants‚Äô motions to continue the May 9 expert witness disclosure and CIPA Section 5 notice deadlines,‚Äù Smith said.

I'm hoping that this is something Judge Cannon rules on, like on paper, and Jack Smith decides enough is enough and takes her to the higher court. But I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know if that would work or if he can even do that. Let me know what you think.",1,1,0,0

First, Israel struck Iran.  ""Israel should count score and strike back against Iran when the time is right"" is absolute nonsense.  Israel is the aggressor, and Iran has been the MORE reasonable party throughout all of this.  More reasonable than Israel OR Joe Biden.  Donald Trump tore up the Iran Deal because he hated everything Obama did.  What is Biden's excuse for not getting back into that deal 3 years later?  There isn't one.  Pure 1990's-era Zionist lunacy and pure stubbornness.

It is actively a terrible, terrible thing that we are helping fund our ""ally"" Israel as they starve and massacre innocent people as collective punishment for an attack that their general brutal treatment of Gazans had specifically propelled.  The fact that they ALSO want a world war--want to start one that US dollars and troops will have to fight--should immediately mean that we stop all funding to these rogue ungrateful f\*cking psychopaths, not that we leap into rebuilding their forces so that they can go and attack Iran again.  So that they can go and shoot sobbing people who are looking for their dead children's remains in the rubble in Gaza.

Frum has wanted a regional Middle East war for decades.  He has never ever cared about how many people will die, how close we could be to nuclear conflict, or how many trillions of dollars we throw into various holes in the world so we can protect corporate oil and defense interests.  Him championing the Great Work of Joe Biden for continuing to fund war crimes and catastrophic offensive provocations is almost literally sickening.  And, BTW, those war crimes will also likely cost Biden the slim chance he still has to be reelected.

In the middle of setting the fire, the linebacker was briefly confronted by one of the other parents in the neighborhood, who threatened to get the other parents out there to help, so the linebacker killed him because he was coordinating a terror attack on him, the 'victim.'  Oh, by the way, the linebacker had been stealing the 10-year-old's lunch money every day for years, but said it was justified because he was the most moral linebacker in history.""  

Israel had every possible benefit of the doubt and all leeway to stop everyone who was involved with October 7th, including not only Hamas but their funding and people who helped coordinate the attack.  But starving the people of Gaza, attacking every hospital in Gaza, blowing up all of the schools, attacking refugee camps, and having IDF soldiers take videos of each other riding around on the tricycles of children they just slaughtered is not self-defense anymore.  And what are we talking about here?  Israel has been champing for a war against Iran for 20 years.  This particular attack wasn't in self-defense either, they want for the US to fight a global war on their behalf, and they barely hide this.  This was another Israeli provocation, while they knew they had the scrutiny of the world on them for what they are doing in Gaza.  Every time they have the possibility of deescalating, they escalate as much as they can.  

Here is what would hold back Bibi's worst impulses: defunding them.  Even in a situation where Netanyahu can be barely convinced for a few hours to say ""ok, we won't do the ABSOLUTE WORST POSSIBLE THING we can do,"" it's temporary.  What if he decides tomorrow that he's going to attack Iran again?  Biden has put us in a situation where we have no leverage, because if Israel does really escalate this war, there's no way we're going to abandon them, a few harsh words or no harsh words.  Biden is so singularly obsessed with protecting and coddling Israel that he's literally risking American democracy on this decision, since it very well could lose him Michigan.  If Israel attacks and we keep funding them, Biden will have been an actively negative force in this conflict, because Bibi can say ""even when the US president CRITICIZES me, they still give me everything I want, so therefore Israel faces no consequences at all for any military actions she takes, let's just keep attacking our enemies until maybe my citizens love me and stop trying to prosecute me for corruption.""",-1,0,1,0

We didn't fund Hamas's attack, why should we be funding Israel's attack?  20 times as many innocent civilians have been killed by Israel just razing whole neighborhoods than that what happened on October 7th.

Ironically, not only has Netanyahu supported Hamas more than any peace activist in the US has, Israel is helping create the next 20 Hamas groups by its collective punishment of civilians, half of whom are children.  The correct way to defeat Hamas is the same as the correct way to defeat terrorist groups 20 years ago after 9/11.  Win the hearts and minds of the rational people and eventually get them to turn on and isolate the extremists.  What Bush did after 9/11 was to push the moderate members of the Muslim world right into the same camp as the extremists, by uniting them against our disastrous boondoggle in Iraq.  Netanyahu is one-upping this level of stupidity by turning almost the entire world against Israel by the brutality of this needless slaughter.

I cannot think of a better reason for why Trump would disguise his payments to Cohen as a legal retainer except to avoid reporting them as campaign donations. I don‚Äôt think it was to throw his wife off the scent, as I highly doubt she‚Äôs paying close attention to his finances.

The DOJ declining to prosecute doesn‚Äôt make Trump innocent of those allegations. Trump definitely made those payments and they certainly appear to violate New York campaign finance laws. The difficulty for the defense here will be establishing reasonable doubt that Trump either didn‚Äôt direct Cohen to make those payments (nearly impossible), or that he didn‚Äôt do so to benefit himself politically.

- Trump buying the Stormy Daniels Story = Legal  
- Trump motivated to do so to stop 2016 election dirt = Legal  
- Trump lying about the nature of the payments on his forms = Illegal, misdemeanor  
Trump ***using campaign contributions to do it*** = Illegal, felony

My prior argument was that his motivations could be argued to be more complicated than that. We may agree that it's not likely about hiding things from Melania, but it doesn't have to be likely - just reasonable doubt. And don't forget, even if Melania isn't a concern, there's the Trump Children to consider. Not that I think he has even that much shame, but it would be nice. 

Still, if you concede he did it for politics, I still don't think that gets you to a conviction. You have to prove he lied about the nature of the payments to Cohen to get the misdemeanor conviction, and much much more importantly, you have to specifically prove it was campaign contributions to get the felony enhancement.",1,1,0,0
1c4o95n,TheIllustriousWe,1713198544.0,">Trump lying about the nature of the payments on his forms = Illegal, misdemeanor

Correct, except elevated to a felony when this was done in service of committing another crime (illegal campaign donation). 

>We may agree that it's not likely about hiding things from Melania, but it doesn't have to be likely - just reasonable doubt

Except it becomes unreasonable when the defense inevitably fails to demonstrate it was likely that Melania would have even noticed, let alone questioned those payments. Even if the ledger literally said ‚Äúhush money for affair,‚Äù no reasonable person is going to believe she would have even seen the ledger.

>even if Melania isn't a concern, there's the Trump Children to consider

Again, highly doubtful. Don‚Äôt forget that Trump to this day denies the affair ever happened. It would be an unprecedented change in both legal strategy and his own character for Trump to suddenly admit he lied all along because he was ashamed his children (most of whom are adults and born to mothers he divorced following highly public adulterous affairs) might find out he was doing what he‚Äôs always done his whole life.

>You have to prove he lied about the nature of the payments to Cohen

That won‚Äôt be hard. Cohen did not appear to have provided any other legal services for Trump that justified payment in the exact amount of the hush money payment, minus a little extra for his trouble.

>you have to specifically prove it was campaign contributions

Which, again, I don‚Äôt think will prove too difficult when the defense inevitably fails to establish reasonable doubt that the payments were disguised for some other reason besides benefiting himself politically.",1,1,0,0

To be clear, I don't want any of this, I want to believe in actual justice systems and people being held accountable, but after several years of watching nothing happen to Trump, I've given up anything will, at least until November. There's still a chance if he loses the election (winning being a non-zero chance even now, mind you), that something will happen then.

Can you still buy a pistol? A bolt action rifle? A shotgun? Yes. You can still own plenty of guns. Just not this specific category of guns. A thing which we have done before.

Can you buy a machine gun? Not since the 1930s. Because we decided being able to unload hundreds of rounds into your fellow man was something we should limit to the battlefield and not the bakery back home.

And regardless, yes. I want us to go after the right to own guns. I want us to reduce the number of guns sold and owned in this country.

You know how there were much fewer wrecks during the COVID quarantines because there were no cars on the roads?

1c4bsqx,Comfortable-Trip-277,1713185857.0,"This is a common misconception so I can understand the confusion around it.

You're referencing the prefatory clause (A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State), which is merely a stated reason and is not actionable. 

The operative clause, on the other hand, is the actionable part of the amendment (the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed).

Well regulated does NOT mean government oversight. You must look at the definition at the time of ratification.

The following are taken from the Oxford English Dictionary, and bracket in time the writing of the 2nd amendment:

1709: ""If a liberal Education has formed in us well-regulated Appetites and worthy Inclinations.""

1714: ""The practice of all well-regulated courts of justice in the world.""

1812: ""The equation of time ... is the adjustment of the difference of time as shown by a well-regulated clock and a true sun dial.""

1848: ""A remissness for which I am sure every well-regulated person will blame the Mayor.""

1862: ""It appeared to her well-regulated mind, like a clandestine proceeding.""

1894: ""The newspaper, a never wanting adjunct to every well-regulated American embryo city.""

The phrase ""well-regulated"" was in common use long before 1789, and remained so for a century thereafter. It referred to the property of something being in proper working order. Something that was well-regulated was calibrated correctly, functioning as expected. Establishing government oversight of the people's arms was not only not the intent in using the phrase in the 2nd amendment, it was precisely to render the government powerless to do so that the founders wrote it. 

This is confirmed by the Supreme Court.

>1. The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Pp. 2‚Äì53.

>(b) The prefatory clause comports with the Court‚Äôs interpretation of the operative clause. The ‚Äúmilitia‚Äù comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens‚Äô militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens‚Äô militia would be preserved. Pp. 22‚Äì28.

>(c) The Court‚Äôs interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment. Pp. 28‚Äì30.

>(d) The Second Amendment‚Äôs drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. Pp. 30‚Äì32.

>(e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Court‚Äôs conclusion. Pp. 32‚Äì47.",1,1,0,0

When you explain to conservatives its really reallocating funds to actually better our rehabilitation process to keep people out of jail again, especially for drug consumers, a lot of them start agreeing and tells you story about how drugs personally ruined their or a family members lives.

There can be restrictions only if they are consistent with this nation's historical traditions of firearms regulation.

From the Supreme Court.

>After holding that the Second Amendment protected an
individual right to armed self-defense, **we also relied on the
historical understanding of the Amendment to demark the
limits on the exercise of that right**. We noted that, ‚Äú[l]ike
most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is
not unlimited.‚Äù Id., at 626. ‚ÄúFrom Blackstone through the
19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any
weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for
whatever purpose.‚Äù Ibid. For example, we found it ‚Äúfairly
supported by the **historical tradition** of prohibiting the carrying of ‚Äòdangerous and unusual weapons‚Äô‚Äù that the Second
Amendment protects the possession and use of weapons
that are ‚Äú‚Äòin common use at the time.‚Äô‚Äù Id., at 627 (first
citing 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 148‚Äì149 (1769); then quoting United States v. Miller,
307 U. S. 174, 179 (1939)).

>""Under Heller, when the Second Amendment‚Äôs plain text
covers an individual‚Äôs conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects that conduct, and to justify a firearm regulation the government
must demonstrate that the regulation is consistent with the Nation‚Äôs
historical tradition of firearm regulation.""

>""Historical analysis can sometimes be difficult and nuanced,
but reliance on history to inform the meaning of constitutional text is
more legitimate, and more administrable, than asking judges to ‚Äúmake

Yes, archery is designed to destroy as well, and you are practicing killing things when you shoot your bow. The arguments are exactly the same. Slingshots, spears, throwing knives, hell even *darts at the local pub*.

Hand eye coordination itself evolved in humans for one reason, and it was killing.

.22lr was not designed for target practice, it is the second or third most shot round on the planet (after .226 and 7.62mm, im just guessing here.) for a reason, and that is killing.

[Dilatory tactics.](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Dilatory)

QUOTE: Tending to cause a delay in judicial proceedings.

Dilatory tactics are methods by which the rules of procedure are used by a party to a lawsuit in an abusive manner to delay the progress of the proceedings. For example, when numerous motions brought before a court for postponement are baseless, time is wasted because the court must stop the course of ongoing proceedings to examine whether there is any merit to the motions. The party in whose interests the motion is brought uses this tactic to gain time to enhance his or her position, or to postpone an action by a court as long as possible to minimize the impact of a decree rendered against him or her. A party found to engage in dilatory tactics may be held in Contempt of court.",1,1,0,0

On the other hand, Cohen ended up with jail time for his part. The judge probably IS going to be fair but also is probably not going to be lenient, so if there is similar precedence of jail time for similar enough crimes, I could see him opting for it - he seems pissed at Trump and team (for good reason). There is also the gratuitous number of charges. Could use that, if found guilty on most or all, as a reason that a fine might not be considered enough.

While Ripley is finding out about her daughter growing old and dying, Burke sends a message to the colony posting a prospecting notice to check out the coordinates of the derelict alien ship from the first film. 

The kids are seen running around the station playing, riding big wheels, and again in the family rover vehicle as their family goes to investigate with the promise of having a claim to whatever they find there. Dad gets a face hugger off camera and Newt screams a lot. Essentially showing how the infestation happened. 

There were some extra scenes gathering supplies after the botched operation and drop ship crash, Bishop lines calling the remote drop ship, and self-firing turret guns that fight off an initial wave of aliens when the survivors are trapped in the operations center. 

Supposedly it‚Äôs Cameron‚Äôs preferred cut. I remember seeing the turret scenes and Ripley learning about her daughter on a TV edit I taped on VHS in 1988 or something. Around when Critters came out. I was a kid. It was my introduction to the franchise. I preferred that edition actually, as it didn‚Äôt show the initial scenes of a populated Hadley‚Äôs Hope.

Lots of ifs, but most of them favor Trump way more than a normal person.

I can think of one case/situation where a ""not guilty"" verdict has been overturned.

[Details here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Jeopardy_Clause#Fraud) --

> If the earlier trial is a fraud, double jeopardy will not prohibit a new trial because the party acquitted has prevented themselves from being placed into jeopardy to begin with. One such case is the trial of Harry Aleman, who was tried and acquitted in 1977 in Cook County, Illinois for the September 1972 death of William Logan. Nearly 20 years later, two persons under Federal Witness Protection came forward to state that Aleman murdered Logan and another individual, and **also bribed the trial judge to return an acquittal**.    
>    
> Following on the new evidence, the Cook County State's Attorney in December 1993 filed new charges alleging Aleman killed William Logan, an identical allegation for which Aleman had been previously acquitted. He was convicted on that charge and sentenced to 100 to 300 years in prison.

Definitely an unusual situation, but I'd say the courts came to the right decision -- since Aleman wasn't actually in jeopardy the first time, trying him again wasn't double jeopardy.",0,0,0,1

But now he is being more heavily focused on and his incoherent or alarming words are getting deeper into the consciousness of the average voter, which means the rampant ""Joe Biden bad"" misinformation campaigns are less effective.

Here's a slightly more direct take - if the US lost all of it's wars, found itself as a protectorate of the UN, and the UN gave us our land back but told us that we needed to give one state to the native americans, say Oklahoma, I wouldn't try to murder all the native americans for the next 75 years, I wouldn't ally with Putin to kill native americans, I wouldn't vote for a government that said it was a religious obligation of all people in the USA to kill native americans before any of us got to heaven, and I wouldn't pledge that we'd massacre them in a destruction that would go down in history.

I certainly wouldn't murder the leaders of foreign powers that made peace with the native americans, or murder Macron for giving a speech saying that native americans deserve to have their own state.   I wouldn't try to overthrow Mexico so I'd have a place to attack native americans from, nor would I start a civil war in Canada, nor back another country's invasion of Cuba so they'd help me kill native americans.

One of the things I discovered for myself years ago when researching what ‚Äúconservatism‚Äù means, was that it doesn‚Äôt require logical consistency, whereas ‚Äúliberalism‚Äù requires the correcting of perceived injustice. 

All that conservatism requires is that ‚Äúthe system‚Äù be well-understood to the benefit of the individual so that the system can be manipulated in their favour. This drives liberals insane to the complete obliviousness of the conservatives who don‚Äôt understand what the problem is.

That‚Äôs why conservatives abhor change; it forces unknowns into their known system, which they don‚Äôt understand.

For the political center, it is a mix of conservative and liberal values; it doesn‚Äôt like change unless it is obvious to them.

In the last 10 years we have had a lot of social change and events including a pandemic that have caused the center to be overwhelmed.

Not just in the U.S.; I see it here in Canada too. Canada will almost certainly elect a conservative government in the next election. Even though the leader is an obvious charlatan.

Sorry, traveling and on mobile so long-form responses and quotes are limited. I would say there at three main areas to evaluate: economic, social, and budgetary.


Conservative economics holds the free market up as sacred and believes that consumer choice keeps everything balanced. The government should never interfere with the market and its only job is to prevent anyone else from interfering to reduce consumer choice (e.g. monopolies). Going back to the 18th century, the view was the corporations (e.g. East India Trading company) would act like governments to interfere with the free market and governments should prevent this. That makes conservatives generally pro regulation and anti trust. Liberals believe the government should shape the market to benefit society. Republicans are violently anti regulation and shape the market to help corporations, which is very anti conservative.¬†


Social conservatism boils down to the government that governs best, governs least. Often intersects with states' rights in America. Liberal focuses on expanding rights and protections. Republicans believe in using government power to reduce rights and force their desired behavior. And ""state rights are supreme as long as the states do what I want"". Anti conservative.


Budget-wise, conservatives believe in very small governments that only handle necessary features (e.g. military) and balanced budgets without debt. And low taxes. In line with general economic views. Liberals believe in a bigger, more active government that runs programs for the common good. Especially programs you save money on centralizing (e.g. birth control access programs, which have a very high return on investment--often ~5 dollars per one dollar spent). Higher taxes but hopefully good bang for buck. Republicans believe in spending massive amounts of money on inefficient programs and not raising taxes to pay for them, blowing up the debt. Their plan is basically to steal daddy's credit card and throw massive parties, making Democrats clean up after. Again, anti conservative.

Many Republicans (my Congressman included) claims we need to improve the economy, lower inflation & the national debt.  A fourth of our national debt is from Trump's previous tenure.  His economic policies caused inflation to spike even before covid did its damage...

Another big Republican talking point is how millions of illegals are crossing into the nation every day bringing tons of drugs and guns putting American lives at risk.  We have to close the border yesterday!

Yet Mr Trump keeps demanding no action being taken so he can use the chaos to campaign on...  He is willing to let hundreds of thousands of Americans suffer just so he might get an extra vote or two?  Way to put America First!",1,1,0,0

Then, Trump said no, and it all fell apart.

I think their comment was deleted, but it still made me think about why I think it's not healthy for us.  Disclaimer:  I've been strongly opposed to Justice Thomas since his appointment and his actions in recent years are some of the worst, especially him and his wife's support or non-action on attempts to overthrow the government.

1) If you had a wish, like a real honest-to-goodness wish, would you really spend it on making someone die?  Why not wish for them to have a change of heart or to retire after reevaluating their life or otherwise to come around to a place where they could attone for the things they have done?

2) Consider that there are others making similar wishes but for people that you like or even care about.  This thought sobers me a bit, especially knowing that some of them may take action to make their wishes come true.

3) Death changes the way people think about things.  Some become lionized in death, or their message gets stronger.  Other times, we forget the terrible things they've done and don't fully process the impacts and correct the causes.

--

I don't want Clarence Thomas to continue as he has been on the supreme court.  I would like to see him replaced.  I'd really like it if the corrupt and treasonous actions he's taken were prosecuted and we as a society prevented them from happening.

>There might actually be a way to do that, because Justice Thomas we have a special offer for you tonight.  We are prepared to offer you $1 million a year for the rest of your life if you simply agree to leave the Supreme Court immediately and never come back.  It is that simple.  Just sign this contract, resign, and the money is all yours. 

> This is not a joke.  If you watch our show you know jokes aren't really our thing.  This is real -- a million dollars a year until you or I die.  We have spoken to experts who've all told us the best they can tell this is somehow legal, which seems crazy to me, cause it really feels like it shouldn't be.  But as they keep pointing out there are no rules in place to stop me from doing this.  And let me be clear HBO is not putting up the money for this, I am personally on the hook.  You can make me really regret this.  I can be doing standup tours to pay for your retirement for years, but this offer is not forever, you have exactly 30 days from midnight tonight to make your resignation effective.  And, if you are still on the fence I actually have a little deal sweetener that I'm excited to show you so please come with me.  [...]

> We are excited to offer you this brand new top-of-the-line Prevost Marathon motor coach.  Look at this beauty, Clarence.  It's worth $2.4 million and it's got a full bedroom, yes that is a king bed, one and a half baths, a fireplace, four TVs, a washer dryer, and I quote a residential sized fridge.  

> And if you're thinking what would my friends say if I take this offer.  Will they judge me as they sit in their boardrooms and mega yachts, and Hitler shrines? Will they still treat me to luxury vacations and sing songs about me off their phones?  Well, that's the beauty of friendship Clarence.  If they're real friends, they'll love you no matter, what your job is, so I guess this might be the perfect way to find out who your real friends actually are.  So that's the offer.

Ehhh...

I loathe Thomas just as much as any sane person, but there are countless factors that could make accepting Oliver's offer non-viable.

For one, if Thomas suddenly left the Supreme Court, then almost certainly every bribe and deal he's taken that could be rescinded, would be rescinded.

That means whoever bought his momma's house will probably foreclose or sell off her home.

Any gifts, including that motor home, would be taken back if at all possible.

Thomas would almost certainly receive threats on him and his family's safety. 

Any deals made for future bribes would be nulled immediately.

Basically, Thomas taking Oliver's offer would be like suddenly trying to leave a Gang or step down from being a high-ranking Mob Boss.

He wouldn't be able to just take the offer and get away free & safe, there would most likely be serious repercussions. 

If I was in Thomas' position and had already stooped so low and sold my soul to the Devil, I sure as hell wouldn't be asking the Devil for Taksie-Backsies, either.

1c4j0bv,oncemoor,1713189692.0,"Well I have a hard time seeing how you will get 12 jurors to all agree on a guilty conviction no matter what the evidence is. This case has elements that a normal case wouldn‚Äôt. The first is one‚Äôs political beliefs or distrust in the government. While jury nullification is prohibited in NY it doesn‚Äôt mean one won‚Äôt vote their conscious. It just takes one person to believe the government is out to get him. The second thing I fear is jury intimidation. Unlike in organized crime cases which requires the mob to dish out retribution for a guilty verdict, Trump literally has millions of whacko‚Äôs and violent followers to carry out intimidation or worse violence without any instructions. Just look at election officials that lives were ruined. Can anyone say they wouldn‚Äôt be afraid of this? Especially knowing Trump and his legal team are going to do everything and anything to expose  the jury regardless if it is legal or not. The third thing is a misdemeanor charge being levied rather than a felony. A juror that is battling with points one and two may feel compelled to go that route. Especially as a felony conviction requires the evidence to show the hush payment was made to defraud the public with election campaign laws. Attorneys could seed doubt that it was for concealing from wife or other reasons. It appears this will be the strategy from what I have read as the evidence of concealment is too great. With the ultimate goal to appeal the verdict of a misdemeanor until the statute of limitations run out.

I've been able to successfully navigate relationships with both of my parents, a die-hard Trumper and a die-hard liberal. I won't let meaning die over lies.

Hillary was then investigated by the FBI prior to the election under the Obama administration for her ‚Äòextremely careless‚Äô handling of classified emails through her private email server. 

However, FBI Director Comey chose not to prosecute based on extremely dubious reasoning. So Trump declined to pursue the issue further. He accepted, begrudgingly, the findings of the FBI and retained Comey during his administration. 

[From an article at the time:](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbis-comey-clinton-extremely-careless-about-emails-but-bureau-will-not-advise-criminal-charges.amp)

> Despite not recommending charges be brought against Clinton, Comey delivered a blistering rebuke of her actions, saying the FBI found that 110 emails were sent or received on Clinton's server containing classified information.

> He added it was possible that people hostile to the U.S. had gained access to her personal email account.

> ""Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,"" he said.

> Comey said seven email chains were classified at the ‚ÄúTop Secret/Special Access Program level‚Äù when they were sent and received on Clinton‚Äôs server.

> ‚ÄúThere is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton‚Äôs position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation,‚Äù Comey said.

> Tuesday's decision helps remove what was arguably the biggest threat to her presidential campaign going forward ‚Äì a criminal referral that could have led to an indictment ‚Äì just weeks before her party‚Äôs national convention in Philadelphia, where she is set to seal her nomination as the Democrat standard-bearer.

> Clinton consistently had downplayed the FBI investigation, even calling it a ‚Äúsecurity review,‚Äù and as recently as June 3 said there was ‚Äúabsolutely no possibility‚Äù she‚Äôd be indicted. Weeks ago, a scathing State Department inspector general report directly countered her long-running claim that her personal email use was allowed, though her campaign continued to defend the candidate‚Äôs actions.",1,1,0,0

His right to freedom of speech is not being violated. He just won't play the game like the rules dictate probably because he is running scared...or at the very least *appears* to be running scared rather than the strong alpha he pretends to be.

Your ""the whole point"" comment assumes a lot. I'm curious to know how you would come to that conclusion. What inside scoop do you have that would negate all of the charges against him? What about even one of the charges against him?

You know Trump lies all the time, right? If what you know about these charges are from what DJT has said, you might want to hold out judgment until he has faced the charges in court and has shown that those charges were just to create a ""look how many charges"" talking point.",-1,0,1,0

Just look at the different factors involved and see the end results for both sides to compare.  Vastly different situations I know, but both controversial as long as you assign controversy to the hush money case.  

>>>>Call the laptop thing dumb all you want but until you either say this case is equally dumb or agree that there is a double standard in both cases in which therein lies the literal reason why Donald will get the same amount of turnout or slightly less than he did in 2020.  Which that reason is that we don‚Äôt hold our own people accountable so why should they?",0,0,0,1

Show me another president using their businesses to provide hush money and moving it through their lawyer as ""retainment fees"" so the lawyer can send the money to a porn star so that porn star doesn't go out and tell everyone he was fucking them while his wife was pregnant with his son.

Donald Trump has been in court plenty of times in the last few months, but on Monday he became the first American president to stand trial for an alleged criminal offense. Day One of the former president‚Äôs trial on charges related to a 2016 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels kicked off in Manhattan ‚Äî and tensions are already running high.

While the trial will open with what promises to be an intense jury selection process, state prosecutors and Trump‚Äôs attorneys preempted the process by arguing over what evidence will be admissible during the proceedings. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg‚Äòs team also pushed to have Trump held in contempt of the court after allegedly violating a gag order put in place by Judge Juan Merchan.

EDIT: Specifically in regards to violating gag orders:

*Prosecutors said they want Merchan to punish Trump for violating the judge's gag order by sharing certain social media posts over the weekend.*

*They said they want the judge to sanction Trump for each of three posts, to tell Trump to take down the posts, and to warn him that another post could result in jail time.*'

EDIT 2: Lunch break until 1:30 EST. Plenty of time for a stretch and to get more popcorn.

  
EDIT 3: Some spicy from the judge about evidence inclusion, protection for Juror ID, Trump using delay tactics again.

  
*Todd Blanche, Trump's lawyer, said the defense team doesn't have certain exhibits for the trial because they ""just got"" a raft of documents from the U.S. Attorney's Office a month ago.*

*Joshua Steinglass, one of the DA's prosecutors, countered that Trump's lawyers have buried the court in thousands of pages of frivolous motions.*

*""You have 24 hours,"" Merchan told Trump's defense. ""Whatever you don‚Äôt identify in the next 24 hours, you will be precluded from using.""*

  
...

  
*Trump's lawyer Todd Blanche asked when counsel will get the names of prospective jurors and how.*

*Merchan said that he would be handing the defense team and prosecution one copy of juror names and one copy of juror numbers.*

*The judge made clear that the list with the names cannot be copied or photographed and must be returned to the court.*  
...

*Trump is asking Judge Aileen Cannon, who is overseeing the Florida case, to push back the current May 9 deadline for his disclosure of expert witnesses and a submission to the Justice Department on what classified information he intends to use during the trial until three weeks after the end of his New York trial.*

*Blanche and another Trump lawyer, Emil Bove, are also representing him in the New York trial and would also be unable to travel to Florida, they said. And Kise can‚Äôt pick up the slack because he will be unavailable due to a planned medical procedure, they said.*

*‚ÄúPresident Trump made these decisions about the composition of his defense team in both cases at a time when there were no scheduling conflicts,‚Äù Blanche and Kise wrote. ‚ÄúNeither President Trump nor his counsel can be in both places at once.‚Äù*¬†

*The special counsel‚Äôs office responded yesterday, urging Cannon to reject Trump‚Äôs request.*¬†

*‚ÄúAlthough the defendants‚Äô motion reads as though the Court were unaware of Trump‚Äôs other case, and as if the defendants had no forewarning that a Section 5 deadline would be set, those premises are plainly wrong,‚Äù counselor to the special counsel Jay Bratt wrote. ‚ÄúThe defendants have had ample notice that these deadlines would be scheduled and have already had months to complete the work.""*¬†

*‚ÄúEach time the Court sets a new deadline in this case and attempts to keep it moving toward trial, the defendants reflexively ask for an adjournment,‚Äù Bratt concluded. ‚ÄúThat must stop.‚Äù*",-1,0,1,0

More from courtroom on the gag order:

https://www.meidastouch.com/news/trump-trial-day-1

> **Judge Merchan then warned Trump that although he has a right to be present for his trial, he will be removed from the courtroom if he disrupts the proceedings and put in jail. He also warns him that if he fails to appear for court a warrant will be issued for his arrest.**

> The prosecutors then asked that Trump be fined $1,000 for each of his posts that violate the gag order and that he be warned that if he does it again he will be put in jail. They noted that one of the posts happened while court was going on today.

**UPDATE**

> Judge Merchan will hold a hearing on April 24th about whether Donald Trump violated a gag order and should be fined and held in contempt of court.

(I honestly wonder if this has anything to do with Republican objections to FISA renewal, as that's usually a concern of the left...)

So I don't think there is any way they are going to use the mob to create any legal fictions surrounding the certification. If they want to show up on Jan 6, 2025, every one of them will be matched by five counterprotestors, five cops, three Guardsmen and an FBI agent. They simply cannot muster the amount of people that anti-fascist forces can, or that government agencies can. They had their shot at the January 6 strategy and they blew it.

It's the fact that our would-be brownshirts have a very high rate of motor scooter usage and are liable to taze themselves in the balls to death that makes it pretty hard for me to take them seriously as a threat. Do you think they'd have a prayer in guerilla warfare against the gangs of DC or Chicago (who would probably happy ally with each other against a common threat in such a situation)? Or for that matter, the US military - who are very unlikely to side with MAGA, given the enlisted's demographic composition - mostly young, non-white people - and the Officer Corps's high level of education. Both are groups Trump is terribly unpopular with. (I don't think military personnel like his lack of discipline and honor, either, or his constant threats to deploy them to Iran or wherever else.)

So what I'm talking about is just, once it's clear Trump has lost, and will not be taking power - what will his cult do then? Like the other responder said, there will be individual acts of terrorism, for sure, but there is no short-term existential threat to the US government as long as Donald Trump is not part of it.

If he just straight up wins the election, well, then things will deteriorate. But I don't see that happening. If white supremacists were going to take over this country they should've gone for it in the Reagan era, or immediately following 9/11. They just don't have the numbers anymore.",-1,0,1,0

It makes you inadmissible if the felony you've been charged with (not even convicted, CBSA has no requirement to presume a foreign national innocent before being found guilty in court) is also an indictable offense in Canada, which are the Canadian legal equivalent of a felony. 

And seeing as how most of the major offenses one could commit in the US that would result in a felony charge are also indictable offenses in Canada, most felons are denied entry into the country. And if any of the offenses involve weapons or violence of any kind, that could result in a lifetime prohibition from entry.

Ok, on to the appeals where this will all get overturned or a minor slap on the wrist and no one needs to worry. Except the bond insurance industry took a look and said ‚Äúnope.‚Äù I‚Äôm sure calls were made and it was still ‚Äúnope.‚Äù Which wasn‚Äôt planned for.

If he loses the appeal, the bond gets confiscated and then the remainder will be ordered to be paid in a very short time frame or they will go to asset seizure again, see paragraph 2. 

When I talk about how people don't really have a grasp on how these things normally work with the court process, it's really getting at things like complaining about how delays are extraordinary when we are only 2 months out from an initial judgment.  2 months.

Darth Trump was a President of the USA. He was so powerful, Yet so wise. He could use the force to influence the medi chlorians to create, Awakeness. He had such a knowledge of the conservative side, He could even keep the ones he cared about, From sleeping. He could actually, Save the ones he cared about from sleeping? The conservative side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. Well what happened to him? Darth Trump became so powerful that the only thing he feared was losing his power, Which eventually of course he did. Unfortunately, He taught the courts everything he knew. Then the courts made him sleep. Ironic, He could save others from sleep, But not himself. Is it possible to learn this power? Not from a liberal.",1,1,0,0

This stock should have crashed and burned based on the fundmentals never mind the lawsuits. Yet everyday big buys happen at inflated prices to stabilize the fall.

Quick edit: I just skimmed the latest S1 filing. If I wasn‚Äôt already against the stock I‚Äôd sure be after reading just the risks section. Key things of note:

1 They call out that they have never relied on industry accepted metrics to operate their business and have no plans to do so. Key things such as ‚Äúactive number of daily users.‚Äù For a media/entertainment platform to ignore DAU is insane. They even state they‚Äôre just too strategic and early days to pay attention to those numbers. Yet are a public company. 

2 they blame everyone but themselves if killing cookies causes their ad business to crumble. They even blame users for rejecting their cookies. The bigger issue here is its well known (for years) that every major browser (including chrome) have been on a path to reduce/eliminate cookies. To call this out as if it‚Äôs new and be a tech company is also insane. 

3 They call out that they might be called out for violating various laws in regards to security and privacy. Going so far as to say that adhering to these laws might be hard and complex for them so if they violate them oh well. Again this is a known thing in the tech industry. Privacy laws, whether in the us or otherwise, are all known. You don‚Äôt go into this industry without the means to adhere as nearly every tool out there can assist or there are services which will help you out with compliance. 

4 they call out users engaging and generating useful content. So if users don‚Äôt make us succeed they‚Äôre to blame. 

5 they call out their own financial statements already released as suspect and a risk. Why would you invest in this?

>As a business, Trump Media has largely underwhelmed: The company lost $58 million last year on $4 million in revenue, less than the average Chick-fil-A franchise, **even as it paid out millions in executive salaries, bonuses and stock.** ...

>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not another company out there that has retail investors like this,‚Äù said Nunes, who this year will receive a $1 million salary, a $600,000 retention bonus and a stock package currently worth $3.7 million. ...

>Many of Truth Social‚Äôs investors say they‚Äôre in it for the long haul. Todd Schlanger, an interior designer at a furniture store in West Palm Beach who said Trump had been one of his customers, said he‚Äôs invested about $20,000 in total and is buying new shares every week.

>Schlanger said he now watches his stock performance every day hoping for positive signs. In a Truth Social post last week, he encouraged ‚Äúeveryone who supports Donald Trump and Truth [Social to] buy a share everyday‚Äù and asked, ‚ÄúDo you think we have hit bottom?‚Äù (The stock slid nearly 10 percent after that post.)

>**He suspects the recent drops in share price have been the result of ‚Äústock manipulation‚Äù from an ‚Äúorganized effort‚Äù to make the company look bad.** There‚Äôs no proof of such a campaign, but Schlanger is convinced. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs got to be political,‚Äù he said, from all the **‚Äúliberals that are trying to knock it down.‚Äù** ...

>Some accounts there have recently encouraged traders to keep investing in a fight they said was about **‚Äúgood vs evil‚Äù ‚Äî a way to defend Trump from the liberal elites laughing at him** and, by extension, them. The user @BaldylocksUSMC said ‚Äúthe fight has been long and hard on most of us‚Äù and that ‚Äúthis stock is not for the weak,‚Äù but that one day they would triumph over critics who were ‚Äúbrainwashed beyond repair.‚Äù ...

>‚ÄúIf I lose it, fine. If I make a profit, wonderful. But at the end of the day, I wanted to show my support,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs such an effort to destroy him and strip his wealth away, and so much glee about it. I would like to see him be a winner.‚Äù ...

>McLain, the tree service owner in Oklahoma, said he believes the stock could ‚Äúgo to $1,000 a share, easy,‚Äù once the media stops writing so negatively about it and the company works through its growing pains. The company‚Äôs leaders, he said, are being ‚Äútoo silent right now‚Äù amid questions about the falling share price, but he suspects it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre working on something amazing and new.

>McLain is an amateur trader ‚Äî he invested only once before and ‚Äúlost [his] butt‚Äù ‚Äî and said he hasn‚Äôt talked to his family about his investment, saying, ‚ÄúYou know how that is.‚Äù But he believes the Trump Media deal is a sign he is ‚Äúsupposed to invest,‚Äù he said.

>‚Äú**This isn‚Äôt just another stock to me. ‚Ä¶ I feel like it was God Almighty that put it in my lap**,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve just got to hold on and let them do their job. If you go on emotion, you‚Äôll get out of this thing the first time it goes down.‚Äù

It's one thing to empty your savings account to send Trump a campaign donation. It's another thing entirely to invest in his company and expect a good return on your money because he's such a rich and successful businessman. These stock buyers may have been hesitant to donate more to their savior since they don't profit from it directly but have jumped at the chance to buy stock because they see it as a win/win.

Trump knew the preacher personally‚ÄîCreflo Dollar had been among a group of evangelical figures who visited him in 2011 while he was first exploring a presidential bid. During the meeting, Trump had reverently bowed his head in prayer while the pastors laid hands on him. Now he was gleefully reciting the impious details of Dollar‚Äôs quest for a Gulfstream G650.

>[How Trump Steered Supporters Into Unwitting Donations](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/us/politics/trump-donations.html)

>Online donors were guided into weekly recurring contributions. Demands for refunds spiked. Complaints to banks and credit card companies soared. But the money helped keep Donald Trump‚Äôs struggling campaign afloat.

>Stacy Blatt was in hospice care last September listening to Rush Limbaugh‚Äôs dire warnings about how badly Donald J. Trump‚Äôs campaign needed money when he went online and chipped in everything he could: $500.

>It was a big sum for a 63-year-old battling cancer and living in Kansas City on less than $1,000 per month. But that single contribution ‚Äî federal records show it was his first ever ‚Äî quickly multiplied. Another $500 was withdrawn the next day, then $500 the next week and every week through mid-October, without his knowledge ‚Äî until Mr. Blatt‚Äôs bank account had been depleted and frozen. When his utility and rent payments bounced, he called his brother, Russell, for help.

>What the Blatts soon discovered was $3,000 in withdrawals by the Trump campaign in less than 30 days. They called their bank and said they thought they were victims of fraud.

>‚ÄúIt felt,‚Äù Russell said, ‚Äúlike it was a scam.‚Äù 

>But what the Blatts believed was duplicity was actually an intentional scheme to boost revenues by the Trump campaign and the for-profit company that processed its online donations, WinRed. Facing a cash crunch and getting badly outspent by the Democrats, the campaign had begun last September to set up recurring donations by default for online donors, for every week until the election. ...

>But for some Trump supporters like Ron Wilson, WinRed is a scam artist. Mr. Wilson, an 87-year-old retiree in Illinois, made a series of small contributions last fall that he thought would add up to about $200; by December, federal records show, WinRed and Mr. Trump‚Äôs committees had withdrawn more than 70 separate donations from Mr. Wilson worth roughly $2,300.

>‚ÄúPredatory!‚Äù Mr. Wilson said of WinRed. Like multiple other donors interviewed, though, he held Mr. Trump himself blameless, telling The Times, **‚ÄúI‚Äôm 100 percent loyal to Donald Trump.‚Äù**",1,1,0,0

1c4hrwt,ShySpecter23,1713190891.0,"The problem with polling data this far out in an election year is the constantly changing political landscape that influences these polls. You'll hear about how poor Biden is handling the Israel/Palestine - possibly Iran - conflict and all of a sudden his polling tanks due to perceived protest voters and fear of international war with America dragged in. All of a sudden, you hear Arizona stole women's right to their bodily autonomy and the fear of abortion restrictions are driving up Biden's polling numbers from women afraid of losing more of their rights.

Ultimately, with how our political landscape is today, a lot of these polls are being driven by fear. Fear over the economy, fear over immigration, fear from international conflict, fear of a woman's free autonomy, fear for LGBTQ+ communities, and fear of American involvement into another war. Every time some big issue occurs, polling data changes with it. I wouldn't be surprised if I see articles coming out later this week showing Biden is losing support from his base over the mishandling of America's response to the Iranian missiles launched over the weekend (assuming he handles the situation poorly) and polls shows he lost support - again.

Polls have less variance when we get closer to election as most of the big scary issues have already happened and it's unlikely a new one pops up a week or two before an election that sways someones mind that drastically.

His problem is that he's an attention whore and he can't handle having a single day where he's not the only thing people talk about

Most aren't really Republicans, they're Trumplicans.  So when we point to 2018 and 2022, those are not accurate indications.  The Republican Party is struggling, because the majority of the country is vaguely Liberal or Leftist, and even most Republicans are disgusted by their party.  But they WILL come out for Trump.  In 2016 and in 2020, Trump significantly OVERPERFORMED his polling, while the rest of the party largely does not.  

So I don't think there'll be a giant red wave in 2024, though it is certainly very possible, maybe even 50/50 that Republicans narrowly take the Senate and narrowly hold the House.  But Trump himself is a gigantic favorite to win in November.

Biden had a 52% approval rating on Election Day 2020, and just barely won (it took 4 days to even make sure he had won).  He has a 39% approval rating right now, 3 points lower than Trump's is.

"Trump is the choice for me if no other Republican presidential hopefuls come along to replace after the primaries. Biden is a good man as he stands by Israel and Ukraine but sadly he's being compelled by his former boss, Obama, who vowed to make America pay for what he called decades of victimization of Muslims by past US presidents. He was so eager to tell this to the world that he rushed to Cairo - a Muslim capital - as soon as he could after being inaugurated. I wish  Biden never had to content with Obama like this. He would have done much better!",2024-02-06T01:35:20Z,-1
"Trump is a better bet compared to Biden, although he's a good man when he stood by Israel and Ukraine in their hour of need. But one caveat for Trump he's ever ready to abandon Ukraine to nurture his friendship with Putin, and that's damper too.",2024-02-06T01:21:38Z,-1

"Isn't it funny that Democrats and their supporters believed this man stole the 2016 election from Clinton with the help of Russia? There was no evidence discovered back then and the accusations were never based on any kind of it. 
   And yet, today the same exact people actualy think that the 2020 elections were won fair and square by Joe Biden, even though there have been tons of reports by peole (reports usually are BASED on evidence) about the problematic counting system that could easily lead to the present electoral result by fraud. 
   Trump may not have been a great President. Like all of his previous ancestors, he made many mistakes. But if there's anybody who believes that most of his decisions came without proper thought, he truly is brainwashed by the media and its cellebrities, who did nothing for the past 4 years but always falsely accusing, perhaps one of the most tallented Presidents the US had in the past 30 years. He was hated because he was not a politician, there is no other reason behind that and you cannot deny it. Shame on you.",2020-11-08T22:49:37Z,-1

Going to be an interesting campaign run for sure. I would like to hear some other professional perspectives of this guy.,2015-06-16T23:16:02Z,1
Presidential campaign  or a clan rally I was all in I was just hoping he didn't duly anything about Obama not that I care about the guy but I was like yhis is your moment to prove to us why you should be not why someone else who is already on there way out should never had been. Second if this guy get elected prepare to see a lot of dumb shit that will only benefit the wealthy happen ahh o well and vets have been abandoned since forever it nice for someone to say they want to change that but this dude don't know nothing bout no military stand point I can see him going to speak to negotiate truths and when it goes south he's going to say your fired hahahahaha I'd rather have Hilary ,2015-06-16T22:50:13Z,1

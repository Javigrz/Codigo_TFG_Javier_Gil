Trump is the choice for me if no other Republican presidential hopefuls come along to replace after the primaries. Biden is a good man as he stands by Israel and Ukraine but sadly he's being compelled by his former boss, Obama, who vowed to make America pay for what he called decades of victimization of Muslims by past US presidents. He was so eager to tell this to the world that he rushed to Cairo - a Muslim capital - as soon as he could after being inaugurated. I wish  Biden never had to content with Obama like this. He would have done much better!;2024-02-06T01:35:20Z
Trump is a better bet compared to Biden, although he's a good man when he stood by Israel and Ukraine in their hour of need. But one caveat for Trump he's ever ready to abandon Ukraine to nurture his friendship with Putin, and that's damper too.;2024-02-06T01:21:38Z

Dude, he was the best we have had in a long time. Why did we elect Biden??;2023-01-08T04:52:59Z
He has been the only one in my 76 years who put the people and US first. I cant understand why so many people arnt seeking the truth. Neil Young's song said it all. Does anyone look for the truths, think that the step on the escalator at that exact line was not planned. It is all about the children. Who watched the weekly border briefings???  Never saw them on mainstream media, a real eye opener about a President who was in it for others not himself.;2022-12-29T15:35:53Z
This made sense back then, but now it doesn't. Trump turned out to be another sellout which is what you have to be to become president. I voted for him the first time, but voted 3rd party the second time. Trump needs to let it go and move on.;2022-12-20T14:12:29Z

-get impeached  
-be the president during a worldwide pandemic 
-lose to the previous Vice President 
-claim voter fraud 
-potentially cause one of the biggest riots in American history (depending on who you ask)
-get impeached again
-don’t attend the inauguration

"Isn't it funny that Democrats and their supporters believed this man stole the 2016 election from Clinton with the help of Russia? There was no evidence discovered back then and the accusations were never based on any kind of it. 
   And yet, today the same exact people actualy think that the 2020 elections were won fair and square by Joe Biden, even though there have been tons of reports by peole (reports usually are BASED on evidence) about the problematic counting system that could easily lead to the present electoral result by fraud. 
   Trump may not have been a great President. Like all of his previous ancestors, he made many mistakes. But if there's anybody who believes that most of his decisions came without proper thought, he truly is brainwashed by the media and its cellebrities, who did nothing for the past 4 years but always falsely accusing, perhaps one of the most tallented Presidents the US had in the past 30 years. He was hated because he was not a politician, there is no other reason behind that and you cannot deny it. Shame on you.";2020-11-08T22:49:37Z

Obama a negative force? he was more like plain non-force, and indeed as Trump remarked, he had been impressive during the campaign in 2007-2008, but that quickly vanished after he actually took office. the one baffling thing is how the media keeps portraying him as some superhero even now in 2020, forgetting that the guy they so much hate, namely Trump, was indeed elected because of Obama's inability to deliver. and internationally, in Germany at least, he is viewed very favorably after doing very little while Trump is viewed quite negatively to say the least after doing more than just a little bit for international peace.;2020-10-29T16:32:21Z

Let's Make America safer against terrorism, bring back jobs, bring back to manufacturing to be made here in America, and U.S. Troops, we will Make America Great Again without Donald Trump a stupid racist disgraceful Republican. Trump crossed the line, and he's crazy. He's out of control. This is his fault for sexual assault on women, kissing with women without permission is prohibited is a serious offense.

Honestly, I’m not a Trump supporter. I do not agree with his policies, and I do not feel he is the definition of a “professional” leader. On the other hand, he is willing to call out problems on both political parties, and he is willing to say what’s on his mind regardless of whether it makes him a popular leader. And for that, he has earned my respect;2020-01-15T18:46:48Z

I have a really good question. Trump announced his candidacy on Tues, 14 Jun 2016. How then could CNN upload this video on the SAME DATE, reporting that the DNC was hacked by Russia and stole their research on Trump? How did the DNC already have research on Trump either before or on the same date he announced his candidacy?

I once had a conversation with someone who wasn't a fan of Donald Trump. I asked the person what would happen if he won. There was no way he could win the person commented. I saw the person later after Donald Trump's first presidential election which occurs every four years in this country. The person was still in shock and tears. At that time I could understand but today I just laughed cause both parties are drinking the Kool-Aid from the same cup...smh.,2024-03-03T13:13:10Z,-1,0,1,0

THERE IS A SPIRITUAL ENEMY WHO IS ALSO NATURAL WHO WANTS TO DESTROY THE UNITED STATES; AND IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IT IS HIDING BEHIND THE HUMAN NATURAL,

DO YOU KNOW WHY THEY HATE DONALD TRUMP?? BECAUSE IT ALWAYS SUPPORTS THE PEOPLE OF GOD AND IS AGAINST THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE PRINCIPLES OF THE WORD OF GOD, WE SHOULD PRAY FOR THE UNITED STATES; MORE THAN EVER, BECAUSE THERE ARE DARK FORCES BEHIND THE CURTAIN,
THAT WE DO NOT SEE IN THE PUBLIC LEADERSHIP; BECAUSE WITH RESPECT TO MY AMERICAN BROTHERS THE CURRENT PRESIDENT IS JUST A FIX AND HOW THEY HAVE MADE MOCK OF MY AMERICAN BROTHERS,

ALSO AS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN I REGRET; BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES IS A BLESSING FOR MY FAMILY AND MY NATION, BLESSINGS THE UNITED STATES BLESSINGS AMERICA VICTORY TRUMP, VICTORY AMERICA,

Because we have NO fight against flesh and blood; BUT against principalities, AGAINST powers, against lords of the century, governors of this darkness, against spiritual malice in heaven.
THOSE HIDDEN SPIRITS,

Therefore, HIDDEN SIN;
take all the armor of GOD, so that you can resist on the bad day, and stand firm, finished all the work.

So stand firm, girded your loins of TRUTH, and clothed in the coat of justice.

ABOVE ALL, taking the shield of FAITH, with which you can put out all the fiery darts of the evil one.

"INDICTED today in the hush money case. History was made on 30 March 2023. The era of the imperial presidency is over: no ex-president is above the law; no bogus claims of ""executive privilege"" after leaving office (Secret Service protection notwithstanding); no more lies will be tolerated. Simultaneously, the unredacted transcripts of Dominion Voting Machines VS Fox has revealed  the company deliberately pushed the stolen election lie, knowing it was bogus, and expressly to profit off it's misinformed viewers. The correspondence behind the scenes shows complete disdain for Trump and the viewers themselves. And all involved may be forced to testify (trial begins April 17). Now would be a good time for those who have trusted and been betrayed by Fox to step outside the bubble and watch what happens in the courts carefully, because whatever happens inside that courtroom will be run by a no-nonsense judge who has already admonished Trump's counsel in a prior case. Do not diminish the solemnity of the first president ever indicted for crimes. But understand: this is really happening. There is a whole world if truth outside the gaslighting of Fox, Newsmax, and the rest. Reach out. We're here to console you. You've been had. 😢",2023-03-31T09:36:40Z,-1,0,1,0

"People are quick to mix in others’ private life in their professional life. They don’t realize that Trump actually did some amazing things. Not just good, amazing. He’s the first president to meet with North Korea’s leader, and actually tried to come to an understanding. Under Trump, very few nuclear tests were made and very little aggression was found in DPRK. He created jobs for many people, in fact, several of my friends had it really well under him. He removed Obamacare which, had Obamacare worked, he would not have removed in the first place, but in implementation, it forced people without insurance to pay for something almost no hospitals accepted. I hope he wins 2024, because I’d love to see what else can happen.",2023-03-21T08:06:36Z,-1,0,1,0

I really believe that Trump naively thought that the media and the Washington establishment might start to work with him after he won. I think he got into office and totally underestimated how low these people would go (they were already spying on his campaign) and how deranged they would become in order to cast out someone who only wanted what was best for the country but wasn't an insider.,2023-02-18T04:25:15Z,-1,0,1,0

"The electoral college is meant to represent ALL different people in all different parts of the country. Including people who live in rural areas and are not part of a major city.  Their voices, although less in population vs a major city need to be represented and heard as well.  If the popular vote was chosen to be a representation of the American people, it would outnumber those who do not live in the city and would be a false representation of what an over-populated cluster of people with a city environment desire or want in a country vs those people who live in less-populated rural areas.  It's akin to having a group of high schoolers voting on a person to represent them vs a university with a diverse population of people with different interests and backgrounds.  The electoral college was created to represent every part, every person of every state, small or large population of that state.  If it still does not make sense to you about the importance of the electoral college, research it and you'll understand.  I did the same and it all makes perfect sense.

"i think all presidents are puppets.  Trump is in there to activate the conservative base and direct that a certain way.  I think the current ""powers that be"" had their run and will be replaced by a new power base.  The petro dollar is on its last legs.  They all ready have a replacement system ready to go.

The people are waking up to the Rothschilds and Rockefellors (except for msm lovers) so they have to go to a new command structure.  Hiding behind a conservative front is perfect.  A new digital currency will come in and everything will seem great.  All debts will be erased.  Except its all a trick.

An example of what we are dealing with:  Trump has 58 rooms in Mar A Lago, Trump Tower is 58 floors, 58th presidential inaugeration was Trump.  Not to mention countless articles of Trump and the number 58.  He spent 58 million on legal fees.  Trump backed candidates 58-1 in primaries.

Reality is not what you think.  Trump's uncle worked directly with Nikola Tesla and grabbed all his scientific papers after he died. Tesla worked on time travel.  Much more to mention on all of this.",2022-07-11T16:06:17Z,1,1,0,0

"i love Trump Suported him all the way, voted for him as he is a Truman American.  But even I can see that his wife is a trophy wife who got pregnant out of the blue and she's not happy.  Did you see the way Trump hugged Kelley Ann Conway?  More than a victories feeling IMO.  No problem, ,Presidents getting laid on the side of good lookin President since day one with the exception of Reagan cause he really love his wife Jimmy Carter and Ford and even Nixon Ditto.  Clinton was the worst because he lied over and over again while Kennedy had a silent press agreement.

"That was one of the most unexpected election nights for me as a German. I watched the whole night from Europe until 6 am MET and then went to university. Nobody comes close when the Americans start promoting sports events, concerts or even elections. In Germany the elections is something that is perceived as boring without any emotions. I just looked at the result here and that’s it. I guess that speaks for itself.",2022-03-30T09:13:41Z,-1,0,1,0

And then he actually became president for a single term, and to this day he emails them asking for donations. There are are a lot of gullible racist ignorant idiots in America, and Trump would never socialise with them because the money he inherited from his cruel racist real-estate dad, Fred Trump, sets him apart.",2021-09-23T12:18:28Z,-1,0,1,0

"Well, this speech aged poorly. Instead of making our country even remotely better, nevertheless ""great"", the absolute unwinding of this country will be historically rooted in this very moment, when America elected it's very own autocrat...who only sought to create vertical bonds to himself, and destroyed the horizontal bonds of all Americans to each other. He took the soul of America and claimed it for himself, like the psychopathic narcissist he is. He got Domestic Terrorists to call themselves ""Patriots"" and got them to love other dictators like Putin. He's the most horrific human being in American political history, and the U.S. has finally joined the ranks of Italy and Germany, as a country who finally brought fascism to it's doorstep. He's a stain that will never, ever come out, just like the stain of Mussolini and Hitler hang over those respective countries, as well.

The only President in most of our lifetimes who didn't start any NEW wars.  Brought peace to countries that have been at war since before books were written.  Made five bucks gas money again lol.  Finally cracked down on all the giant corporations who use slave labor in China.  Got Kim to calm down on his Nuke cave.  So much more.  Took care of our Vets who were dealing with the worst treatment from the VA.  Im proud to have had him for the time we did.  Its a shame how he was called so many names.  like racist.  When he was the FIRST and ONLY for a long time to allow African Americans into his private clubs in New York.  no one mentions that though.   I don't blame those that were brain washed.

"To the horror of half of America, Trump uncovered a rock – no, make that a mountain – revealing tens of millions of people who are racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic, chronically out-of-work, poorly-educated, drug-addicted, and gun-crazed; people who are adolescent, embittered, resentful, and violent; people who have been suckled on television and are suckers for conspiracy theories.  As this rabble marched to the polling places four years ago, 100 million Americans remained at home, either because they were happy as pigs in slop or in such ongoing despair that they saw no difference between Trump and “the woman.” And because of an utterly outdated phenomenon known as the Electoral College, a crooked, lying idiot-clown became president. Hopefully, we will soon begin the healing, listening to the experts, masking and socially distancing in huge, unquestioning, fully-understanding numbers. And we will be vigilant as Trump and his minions will continue to threaten the health and lives of all of us.",2020-11-01T23:40:22Z,1,1,0,0

"USA PRESIDENTIAL TRUMP & PENCE TEAM:

The WORD of GOD, Romans 13:01 says, ""Everyone must submit to Governing Authorities.  For ALL AUTHORITY  comes from GOD, and those in Positions of AUTHORITY, have been Placed there by GOD"".  Amen.

The President of The United States is The Chief of The Executive Branch, which also includes The Vice President,  and the Rest of The President's Cabinet, 15 Executive Departments, and Numerous Federal Agencies, Boards, Commissions, and Committees.  The Power of The Executive Branch is vested in The President of The United States, who also acts as Head of The State, and Commander-In-Chief of The Armed Forces.

We are very Proud and Happy to have Two Excellent, very High Caliber, President Donald John Trump, Vice  President Michael (Mike) Richard Pence, and The Executive Branch, for their Leadership, in The Oval Office, located at The White House, Each Day of our Lives.

Thanks very much to President Donald J. Trump's Family to include his Lucky Wife, Melania, (2 Divorced  Wives:  Marlar Maples & Ivana), his Children:  Ivanka, Barron, Donald (Jr), Tiffany & Eric, for their Hardworking Continuous Support.  (Note:  Due to Dress Shoes with High Heels, being worn by Melania, and, Steps to Climb Up & Down, President Donald Trump, has for many times, tried to Hold Melania's Hand, for Physical Security, to AVOID 'Slip & Fall', and, possible Embarrassments on Video Cameras, as 'First Lady').

Thanks very much to Vice President Michael R. Pence's Family to include his Lucky Wife, Karen, his Children:  Audrey, Charlotte & Michael (Jr), for their very Hardworking Continuous Support.

Dr. Abraham Maslow's Theory, 'Hierarchy of Human Basic Needs' has been Published in 1943, to Record, the  Main Physiological Requirements, for Human Survival, which include: VARIOUS Forms / Methods of: Shelter, Food, Water, Clothing, Sleep & Rest, Health, Homeostasis, Transportation, etc ...', beginning with a New Born Baby, from The Cradle to The Grave.

UNLESS an Individual, Receives Inheritances, Gifts, Donations, or, is being a Part of Owning Some Properties, Financial Programs, Each of us WORK for our Livelihoods, to PAY for our Daily Cost of Living Expenses. During our World Pandemic Covid-19 CRISIS, Thanks very much to our World Leaders, to include our Excellent USA Oval Office Leaders, President Donald Trump & Vice President Mike Pence & ALL, for our Stimulus Payments, which have helped to Pay, for our Daily Cost of Living Expenses.

Thanks very much for Approving & Mailing, or, Making Direct Deposits, for a Second Stimulus Payment, to Each  American Citizen, which I am Praying to Receive Soon.

When our 44th USA President Barack Obama, took over The Oval Office, at The White House, during his First  Term, from 01/2009 to 01/2013, he & V.P. Joe Biden Team, Surprised USA, by FREEZING Social Security Income, for 4 years (48 months), which has Caused many Family Units, a Difficult Time, Suffering from Financial Hardships (to include Inflation & Rising Costs), to Pay for their Shelter (Mortgage, Rent, etc ...), Transportation (Air Plane Tickets, Car Loans, Taxis, Railways, Bus Fares, etc ..), Clothing, Food & Drinks, Health, Insurances, etc .... Please DO NOT do this!

The USA needs and wants a PRESIDENTIAL TEAM & LEADERSHIP which will HELP our INNOCENT USA CITIZENS,  to Pay for their DAILY COST of LIVING EXPENSES such as 'SHELTER, CLOTHING, TRANSPORTATION, INSURANCES, FOOD, HEALTH, etc ....'  Those who are AVAILABLE & CAN WORK, need to be EMPLOYED for INCOME, to PAY for their Cost of Living Expenses. THANKS to President Trump & Vice President Pence for Supporting The USA Workers.  

EVERYONE, please VOTE  4 MORE YEARS (From 1/2021 To 1/2025) for TRUMP & PENCE TEAM, who CARES FINANCIALLY about Each Family Unit, in The USA.

GOD Bless USA & Other Countries. In GOD We Trust. Amen.

"I'm predicting the debates will be canceled by claiming that Biden is sick, or has COVID19, something along those lines... If Biden is ""claimed"" to have COVID19, then the Democrats can avoid the debates which will serve two purposes:

1.  They will avoid the public seeing Biden with extreme cognitive decline, and suffering with dementia.

2.  With it being said that Biden has COVID19, the Democrats will be able to push REALLY strong to encourage or enforce mail-in ballots. - Which will help them to cheat & steal the election.",2020-09-07T06:12:12Z,-1,0,1,0

Everyone else was watching the hockey game that night and a waitress saw me watching the election results on my phone and offered to switch one of the Tvs over just for me. I along with everyone else was sure Clinton was going to take it, And all night I kept seeing more and more states rolling in for Trump...and at one point in the night when he took a commanding lead it sunk in...

"I live in South Korea. We are suffering from epidemic disease as well as so called democratic party of president Moon which is actually radical left socialist, pro-china and pro-North Korea party. I just envy you Americans for having such a great president like Donald Trump who always puts America first. Since our president Moon always puts China and the dictator regime of North Korea first, we Koreans no more have any trust in our goverment of South Korea. President Moon has ignored petitions of more than 1300000 Korean people and just let countless Chinese people who may have Corona virus come to Korea without appropriate preventive measures. Now the epidemic is overwhelming all over the country and most of us cannot buy masks anywhere while the goverment has given millions and thousands of masks to China and North Korea. Few days ago, some of netizens of Korea noticed abnormal traffic increase of internet accsess from China to the national petition web site of the Blue House as well as explosive increase of negative, hostile comments under the news articles which criticize the goverment policy and the president. Through fishing links inducing people to click on anti-communist or anti-Chinese goverment web sites, they were amazed to find so many Chinese people who have pretended to be Koreans showing terror and embarrassment after visiting those web sites. (As you already know, if Chinese people just click on those kind of web sites, it is reported to security police of Chinese communist goverment right away and they are punished.) Astonishingly, we are finding millions of Chinese spies who have worked on manipulation of public opinion on the internet regarding political issues and social conflicts of Korea. They were at the very center of every issue and malicious agitators who took actions systematically with assertive purpose. In Korea right now, it is becoming known as China Gate. The major media of our country is seriously biased and pro-government. And many congressmen have deep relationship with China fund. So we Koreans are fighting a tough fight against the Chinese comment spies and the government which denies its existence. We do not want to go back to the hurtful history. We do not want to be colonized by China. We feel like that we have been totally deceived by our government. You every Army of BTS, please disseminate this news of China Gate as widely as possible.

Nothing about this speech is divisive and yet the MSNBC and CNN so called journalists claim he is divisive. Some of the promises that haven't been fulfilled yet (rebuilding the Highways and Bridges) is only because the uninformed hateful people who voted for the Democrats to take the House in 2018 has been the cause of this. Once the Tyranny Driven idiots won the house all they've done is divide and attempt to remove Trump. The only Real Way to stop this is to take back the House and Keep the Senate in 2020.

Our injustice is recognized by a leader who will fight establishments, and global encroachments that increasingly bear on us. One by one establishments topple and the media broadcasts about the rattle. Trump, we, are winning. Making America great again is a vision that any American who is identifying with their losses rather than their gains will choose to follow. Trump is America's Robinhood. The American media plays its role too. The best way to rally support for a spirit of justice is to have another criticise it. But feathered arrows, fictitious facts, indictments, impeachments and the rest are elements of the same story. In this iconography a symbol of injustice prevails because the counterforce names it unjust. So you'll have to be more clever than leaving this to the media. You can't defeat a symbol, but change its meaning you can. Fiction precedes fact.

His term will mark the start of something great - something that will change America FOREVER. Enough with all the fake news. Enough with media censorship. We need the truth! The solution! Trump has granted us with the start to the solution, now let's continue it. Vote for Trump in 2020. Let's give him a second term to continue his amazing progress.

"if you are a widow and want to remarry or if you are single and you still want to marry a good faithful man see the prophet Hey,I'm so excited my broken Marriage has been restored & my husband is back after he left me and our 2 kids for another woman. After 8 years of marriage, me and my husband has been into one quarrel or the other until he finally left me and moved to California to be with another woman. i felt my life was over and my kids thought they would never see their father again. i tried to be strong just for the kids but i could not control the pains that torments my heart, my heart was filled with sorrows and pains because i was really in love with my husband. Every day and night i think of him and always wish he would come back to me, I was really upset and i needed help, so i searched for help online and I came across a website that suggested that prophet Muhammad Reyansh Rahul can help get ex back fast. So, I felt I should give him a try. I contacted him and he told me what to do and i did it then he did a (Love spell) for me. one month later, my husband really called me and told me that he missed me and the kids so much, So Amazing!! So that was how he came back after a month later,with lots of love and joy,and he apologized for his mistakes,and for the pain he caused me and the kids. Then from that day,our Marriage was now stronger than how it was before,All thanks to prophet Muhammad Reyansh Rahul. he is very powerful man of God and i decided to share my story on the internet that prophet Muhammad Reyansh Rahul is a real man of God and very powerful spell caster who i will always pray to live long so i can help his children in the time of trouble, if you are here and you need your Ex back or your husband moved to another woman, do not cry anymore, contact this powerful spell caster now.

I have one thing to say to trump. I'm fine if he's president as long as he considers this. We need to STOP aid that we send to Africa. And that is not going to hurt them at all. I'm saying that the AID is only hurting them more. AID is sending them food and let's say shoes but once they get over to Africa they are just making the shoe makers poor just. Is making even more people poor and I'm tired of it they need all the help they can get so whoever wants to fly to Africa and. Teach Africans how to build their business and help save many many lives it will help us all seriously.,2019-01-19T15:30:39Z,-1,0,1,0

"I have always been a Democrat supporter, but I must confess.. I love DT. He's perfect for USA, a mix of Ted Roosevelt and a new age Reagan. Who better to grab the collars of the world market and give them a good shake. He's right US has been pissed on for so long because EE is so jealous of her ultimate success, its time to bring it back where it belongs. DT has set a new presidence, tough no nonsense bullshit, I just hope more like DT will run for office, lobbyist free, not afraid and takes the bull by the horn. For the US sakes I hope the People give him another 4. Can we see more of the 1st lady? especially her amazing outfits, she is so gorgeous..maybe another Roasting show, if it may help with the 2nd term, instead of Situation, Snoop Dog and etc, maybe members of Dem. Party. Love Ivanka she's gorgeous, but i think she may have made a mistake.. I don't think its a movement.. I think DT has become a... Phenomenon.",2018-11-07T08:02:25Z,1,1,0,0

"One thing is clear and that is Trump has no idea that he is lying when he does, and he does so on a daily basis, He has no idea the he has no fundamental knowledge of basic topics. He has no idea that he insults gold star families or that he is accountable for his actions that sent troops into harm's way. But he believes that he knows how to wage war, after all he has seen the movie Patton!

He’s keeping promises we thought were lost. This man was not a politician but a businessman and the difference is politicians work for their own party and a businessman works for the entire business.

Now, if you all would've voted for the stronger democratic candidate (Bernie) then who knows what would've happened. You guys should've followed our lead by refusing to vote for Hillary.

"I stayed up all night waiting for this speech. True, real Americans spoke up. And they spoke in volumes. This was the day I got my country back.i am a Naval veteran and a proud one who served his country proudly. As will our beloved commander in chief, president Donald J Trump.
 For those liberals out there who want to play the race card against my beloved commander in chief, let me say this. A little racism here and there is not exactly a bad thing. It's how we protect ourselves against our enemies. For those who get caught up in collateral damage, not our fault. Your own people did this to you. And as such you must bear the brunt of the pain. 
America will once be great again. We have survived the Clinton, Bush and Obama regimes and now it's time to set things right. 
The ones who made this day possible are the true, hard working,  Americans who pay their taxes and do this country proud every day of their lives. Not the bottom feeders who milk the system without pitching in. The ones who drain our economy and take the free ride. You know who you are. You come in all forms, all races, all religious factions and all colors. Donald Trump is coming for you. If it takes the national guard to go door to door and round you all up, then that's what we'll do. You can run, but you can't hide. 
Am I a racist ???, let me educate you all. Everyone is a racist to a certain degree. It can't be avoided. People are just more comfortable around their own kind. But is your here legally and work hard and pay your taxes like all the rest of us, then you have nothing to fear. But if your in the POTUS target range. Get out now while  you still can. Because if Trump gets you. Your journey back will not be a pleasant one. 
For now, good night, good bless America and good bless Donald Trump. Amen.",2018-03-31T15:17:04Z,1,1,0,0

LET’S FACE IT!  DONALD TRUMP HAS MANAGED THE SAME PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN THAT MITT ROMNEY DID IN 2012.  HE IS PRESENTING AN ECONOMIC POLICY THAT WILL NOT CREATE JOBS HERE AT HOME.  HE WANTS TO KEEP TAXES LOW FOR HIS RICH BUDDIES (TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS).  YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS?  THE RICH GETS RICHER AND THE POOR GETS PREGNANT.

"If there was a word to describe the liberal mindset on November 8th, it was SMUG....

 I don't think that in all my years on earth I had ever seen that level of smugness by any party on election day. As I watched news reports and pundit panels and discussions, the liberals were exhibiting what I might describe as a ""rancid effervescence."" Some of the nastier personalities in the liberal world leered at the cameras and at Trump supporters and touted how Hillary  Clinton was about to ""wipe the floor"" with Trump and his supporters..... 

At the polls, especially in liberal bastions in New England and on the Left Coast, Clinton supporters in line to vote were already in celebratory moods and they were almost giddy talking to one another about what the night would bring. They congregated together yelling slogans and carrying placards and wearing t-shirts dissing Trump and praising Clinton. Many of them planned celebrations or were invited to liberal sponsored parties where they would celebrate Hillary Clinton's election. ...

Some had life sized cutouts of her that they could pose with--labeled ""MADAME PRESIDENT."" Those rare ones that work rushed home from their jobs and planted their carcasses in front of their televisions and computer screens, hardly able to contain their excitement. As the polls began to close, they ordered in pizza or other eats and no small number had stopped in the afternoon or earlier to purchase alcoholic beverages to celebrate with. As the first results began to trickle in, liberals in front of television sets, and members of the lamestream media were almost rapturous. The earliest results seemed to be indicating that the numbers were favoring Clinton

 On the sets of the liberal media, jubilant smiles were evident and they were almost tripping over their own words when they announced that with (just) 2 percent of the vote reporting from Florida, Hillary Clinton had taken an early substantial lead. Sure, some swing states were reporting Trump in the lead, but it was still early and they assumed the voting in urban areas would take care of any early Trump positives. By 9 P.M. they were still unable (or unwilling) to see the first hints that all might not be going so well. 

But by 10 P.M., there was a noticeable change in their facial expressions and their rancid effervescence no longer seemed to be bubbling on the surface. As states like Florida, North Carolina and Iowa were called for Trump, a twisted worry stole across their faces. And then when Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania turned in Trump's favor, we began to see their stone faces with tears falling from their eyes in profusion. 

The petrified faces of liberals all across the fruited plain seemed almost to emanate the kind of smoke that comes from a fresh, warm dog t~u~r~d on a frosty morn. And as it became more and more obvious that this would not be the coronation that Hillary Clinton anticipated, even the rabid liberals began to acknowledge what was to them unthinkable. Television commentators reluctantly noted that the mood at democratic headquarters had become ""subdued"" and that the crowd was quickly thinning. In liberal households liberal fists pounded on liberal coffee tables all across the nation--accompanied by banal howls of NO! NO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

By midnight, the parties had ended, guests had gone home, cold uneaten pizza lay on kitchen counters. The alcoholic drinks that were intended for celebratory inebriation, would now be used to bring about sleep to troubled and disbelieving liberal minds. Meanwhile, sequestered away from the public, Clinton herself was in a drunken fury, throwing things, cursing, even breaking the screen of a large television gifted her by the Saudis. She physically attacked ""Little Robby"" Mook and others in her entourage and had to be physically restrained as the harsh reality of her utter loss seeped into her pores and saturated her brain cells. 

And when November 9th dawned, liberals began to grapple with what had befallen them, in disbelief, many going silent on public forums, and experiencing evidence of a dementia that was to be called Trump Derangement Syndrome. They dreaded turning on their televisions and their computers. They were sickened by the thought of what the conversations would be like among their conservative co-workers. Some would riot in the street for nights to come.

 Others, like toy poodles threatening Mastiffs, boasted of the possibility of turning members of the Electoral College in Clinton's favor, effectively stealing the election. But in the end, it was Hilary that would experience more Electors deserting her than any other candidate in history. I think it is good to continue, on an ongoing basis, to savor the victory we as conservatives experienced on that night--and the prospects of the implementation of our goals and beliefs via the ever-approaching Horriblismic Onslaught (HORRIBLISM = any event or action that liberals despise and conservatives love). 

The events of November 8th were a mere overture to what Ayn Rand once referred to as The Concerto of Deliverance. Our best hope is that from the liberal perspective, it will all be far worse than they can imagine now. He's THE DONALD--lancing the infected boil of liberalism all over America. And he is wiping your libtard butts with sandpaper.",2017-12-07T07:32:31Z,0,0,0,1

"Donald Trump VICTORY SPEECH -- Is Donald Trump really going to support the Red, White and Blue flag ? What Donald Trump says and does indicates that he knows next to nothing about the foundation of the United States ! Donald Trump is from the most corrupt place in America ... New York City ! It was from New York that John D. Rockefeller, J. P. Morgan and John D. Ryan financed the Bolshevik Revolution that created Communist Russia ! Is Donald Trump also working for the Super Rich who want to bring total ruin to the United States ? The Super Rich have always wanted full scale Monopoly and Total Dictatorship in the United States ! Make no mistake about it the Super Rich have always hated the United States of America ! Is Donald Trump also a supporter of Communism ? I think so ! Not only have the Super Rich supported Communism in Russia but these very same Super Rich have actively down through the decades been supporting Communism inside the United States ! Evidence does show that Donald Trump is working hand in hand with Communist Russia and that the Soviets have supported Donald Trump to become the President of the United States ! It is well known that the Jews invented Communism and that the Jews are the most wealthy people in the world ! All evidence shows that Donald Trump loves the Jews and fully supports the Jews ! In America it is New York City where the Jews live and work ! It is in New York that Alexander Hamilton laid down on paper the detailed plans for Crony Capitalism ! Ever since the time of Alexander Hamilton America by and large has been a Crony Capitalist Country ! Crony Capitalism is not Capitalism ! Is Donald Trump a Crony Capitalist ? I think so ! It is Crony Capitalism that is delivering America into the hands of Communism ! I think so ! Will Donald Trump fully destroy the United States Free Enterprise System by encouraging Crony Capitalism ? I think so ! It is known that if and when Capitalism fails their will be the rise of Nazism ! Nazism is just another form of Communism ! It is also known that the Jews created Nazism ! It is the Jews that created the U.S. Federal Reserve Banks and it has been the Jews that have manipulated the American people to acquire a 20 Trillion Dollar National Debt ! Will Donald Trump through turning America into an Empire greatly increase the U.S. National Debt ? I think so ! The Jews want to create a truly gigantic Stock Market Crash brought on by the Gigantic U.S. National Debt in order to guarantee the total economic destruction of the United States ! The Jews also have plans on bringing about a U.S. National Emergency ! The Jews want massive rioting in all the U.S. Cities so that Permanent Martial Law will be implemented ! The Jews have plans via a U.S. National Emergency to make all handguns and all guns illegal ! The Jews also have plans to make all Freedom of Speech illegal as well as making all voting permanently illegal in the United States ! The Jews also want to Totally Destroy the United States by entering the United States into Thermonuclear World War Three ! No Donald Trump does not support the Red, White and Blue flag but quite the opposite ! Best Wishes -- Joseph Stefurak",2017-09-13T16:04:06Z,1,1,0,0

He is trying to weed out the good from the bad so that we can all feel safe again. I am very grateful for that. Love thy neighbor as thyself and stop all of the hatred,2017-02-16T16:57:52Z,1,1,0,0

"Democratic protesters shout for Unity and PEACE but they are insinuating Civil War or chaos in the USA. Why can't they just accept the loss, promote peace by encouraging the disappointed Democrats to show respect to the new US President and give him a chance to prove his worth as a USA President? What they're doing and even what Michelle Obama said, ""We will be back before you know it"" is an indirect way of telling the Democrats not to stop the protest and they will support the protesters. This is not a way to support the new President but to program the mind of the people that America is in danger because of Trump...but what I see here is...the protesters and their Democrat Leaders encouraging them to protest are the ones putting America in chaos but not Trump. So please accept defeat. I am not a supporter of Trump, I am a Democratic supporter but I disgust the behavior of the Democratic protesters - Hillary and the other Democrats are insinuating chaos instead of Unity and Peace - read between the lines of their speech...so sad...I admire Obama but with his last speech and Michelle Obama's speech there are so many hidden messages to not to stop the protest.

"Mr Trump I believe for the long term future security of Israels best friend and the only friend America has in the Muslim middle east it would be in Americas best interest if She America had a duel command secretary of defense, looking back on the recent history I believe Mr tommy franks would be ideal. What it would mean is command could have the advantage of always having a fresh mind to deal with any and all threats that may come her way, like this, when the mind is forced to deal with sleep deprivation it slowly at an exponentially increasing rate goes into toxic shock, during sleep little dead cells within the brain are washed away by  fluid that comes up through the spine into the brain, during sleep deprivation this does not happen, one other advantage of the fresh mind is that processing capacity is maintained, on less sleep than is optimal brain capability diminishes however this is deceptive in that it happens not because the mind slows down but in laymans terms it does it as fast but it is far harder (essentially it becomes less efficient) the latest research illustrates this in its finding that memory improves with adequate as opposed to less than adequate sleep. respectfully yours adonaitsidkenu p.s. as with there being an optimal amount of sleep there is an optimal processing pace (rhythm) for the brain to function if you will. the most important thing in all of this is just like having money in the bank a sleep credit can be accrued however for optimum results it needs to be saved on a daily basis with a little more sleep each night than is comfortably required over starting period of a minimum of six months",2016-12-18T19:22:50Z,1,1,0,0

It's been a month, and I'm still emotionally overwhelmed and overjoyed.  Great things are about to happen here in America.  They've already begun to happen.  For a month now, America has been in kind of a heightened euphoria as to what's happening to us.  We're excited, and and aspired, and yes, even triggered, for lack of a better word, to do even greater things than we've ever done before.  And Trump is leading the way.  He's working for *US* the way every president should do, but in my lifetime, none has ever done, with the exception of JFK.",2016-12-10T02:18:16Z,0,0,0,1

We can add a few more groups to that great peacemakers eloquent speech.  Every Muslim, Hindu, LGBT and non LGBT, every atheist, every agnostic.  Certainly, as beautiful as the little Hispanic children are, them as well.  I don't care if their parents are undocumented.  They were born here.  They are Americans.  They deserve the same respect.  JFK said, ""United there is little we cannot do in a host of co operative ventures.""  ""Divided there is little we can do.""  Mr, Trump, show us you can be a good and decent man.  Make us proud to have you for president.  Please, no more nasty and harsh words or pitting one group against another.  We understand if someone is a criminal they should be dealt with to the fullest extent of the law.  This certainly does not mean because they are of Mexican descent, they are a monster.  I happen to know that is not true.  We are not supposed to paint with a broad bush.  If someone is a little over weight does not mean we should call them fat slobs.  We all have issues.

"Mind Without Fear
Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;
Where knowledge is free;
Where the world has not been broken up
into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
Where words come out from the depth of truth;
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;
Where the clear stream of reason
has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;
Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action---
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.
--- By Rabindranath Tagore",2016-11-21T17:24:25Z,-1,0,1,0
"Lucas 21 the end of the world.
5 As some said, concerning the Temple, which was adorned with beautiful stones and votive offerings, he said:
6 ""This you see, days will come when there will not be one stone left on a stone that will not be destroyed.""
7 They asked him, ""Teacher, when will that happen? And what will be the sign that all these things are about to happen?""
8 He said, ""Take heed, do not be deceived: for many will come by usurping my name and saying,"" I am ""and"" the time is at hand. ""Do not follow them.
9 When you hear of wars and revolutions, do not be afraid; Because these things must first happen, but the end is not immediate. ""
10 Then he said to them, ""Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.
11 There will be great earthquakes, plague and famine in various places, there will be dreadful things, and great signs from heaven.
12 But before all this, they will lay hands on you and persecute you, giving you up to the synagogues and jails, and taking you before kings and governors for my name, 13 and this will happen to you, that you may bear witness.
14 Therefore, set your heart not to prepare the defense, 15 for I will give you an eloquence and a wisdom, which all your adversaries will not be able to resist or contradict.
16 You will be delivered by fathers, brothers, relatives and friends, and they will kill some of you, 17 and you will be hated by all because of my name.
18 But not a hair of your head shall perish.
19 By your perseverance you will save your souls.
 
mateo 10-7
The kingdom of God is now near.

Matthew 25; 31-46 the final judgment.
31 When the Son of man comes in his glory surrounded by all the angels, he will sit on his glorious throne.
32 All the nations shall be gathered together before him, and he shall separate them from one another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, 33 and shall set those on his right and on the left.
34 Then the King will say to those on his right, ""Come, ye blessed of my Father, and inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world. 35 For I was hungry, and you gave me food; I was thirsty and they gave me a drink, I was on my way, and they lodged me, 36 naked, and they dressed me, sick, and they visited me, I was imprisoned, and they came to see me. ""
37 The righteous will answer him, ""Lord, when did we see you drunk, and feed you, thirsty, and give you drink?
38 When we saw you in passing, and we stayed; Naked, and we clothe you?
39 When did we see you sick or imprisoned, and went to see you? ""
40 And the King will answer them, ""I assure you that every time they did it with the least of my brothers, they did it to me.""
41 Then he will say to those on the left, ""Get away from me, you cursed, go to the eternal fire that was prepared for the devil and his angels, 42 because I was hungry, and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty, and you did not give me 43 I was in the way, and they did not lodge me naked, and they did not clothe me, sick and imprisoned, and they did not visit me. ""
44 These, in turn, will ask him, ""Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty, passing by or naked, sick or imprisoned, and we have not helped you?""
45 And he will answer them, ""I assure you that every time they did not do it with the least of my brothers, they did not do it to me either.""
46 These will go to eternal punishment, and the righteous to eternal Life. """,2016-11-21T16:39:36Z,-1,0,1,0

"We the Indians were very much surprised at the similarities between this election and the election that changed scenario in India 2014. We also have had our share our media pushing their agenda against current prime minister MR MODI by portraying him mass murderer, liar and blah blah blah and completely try to misguide the people in the name of securing values of free speech, secularism and so on and projected how he will destroy the pluralism in India despite peoples wish for a change from the most corrupt regime that India has had in the past. But in the end both the AMERICA and India truth prevailed over propaganda.
It has become a pattern in the world that in the name of preserving the values of secularism and pluralism the rights of the majorities have always been compromised making them vulnerable to attacks by the minorities as they feel very helpless when even media ignores them.

I came across an incident in USA in Seattle where an Indian ( Very Unfortunate to have an Indian involved in this ) lady called KSHAMA SAWANT called  for a nationwide protest against President- elect. Look at the audacity of an immigrant woman to have incited the violence despite being voted by Native Americans instead of urging for peace.
I then came across a comment by a local white guy which I completely agree which is "" I am tired of being shamed as white guy which automatically makes me a racist even if m not"" so similarily peple who voted for MR TRUMP also may have voted for him for his developmental agenda rather that his racists comments which the minorities also must understand.
 
I just feel as an outsider that AMERICA has to survive these tough times to again bounce back and this world in incomplete without country like AMERICA.

A cosmic cluster of gases, planets, fusions on nuclear to molecular levels, particles condensing, expanding, collapsing until suddenly its a bar of iron, and many, many, more unknowns surrounding us at inconceivable distances. The earth being dictated by transdimensional creatures that while ignorant still manage to control and manipulate human society and history. Watching with closed eyes making humans feel independent like our choices and votes matter. Trump or Clinton? Doesn't matter the script is already written and they both follow the exact same path. Both heading towards one goal that has been in the making for untold years. Donald John Trump winning is no accident. He marks the time when the initiative of oppression is on the forefront. However, the beginning of this forefront will be kept hidden under state granted subsidies, false promises of reformations that will alleviate all the nation troubles, and the lies of required inflation of taxes for the rich. Donald Trump has moved us pass the threshold of no return. For the knowledgeable and celestial aware individuals remember that whether we are on terra firma or on a higher plane there is no fear. We, earths children, have the power to stop anything that attempts to stop us. We are the victors in a world burden with defeats.",2016-11-18T04:41:34Z,-1,0,1,0

"What happened to America? Why are we so weak and afraid now? We used to be the greatest. We were a country based on hard work and success. America used to be a fucking grind and a God damn good grind. A country where anything was possible for those who shredded sweat and blood, for those who stayed up on all nighters injecting red bull and 5 hour energy into their pulsating veins. There was gold and glory for the competitive hardworking people, those willing to do whatever it takes to reach the top, fighting others to victory and the pursuit of happiness. America was all a mental game the smartest and most dedicated work at the top. But not anymore. We have a bunch of scared pussies in the streets protesting against a man who has promised change, a man who is pro life, a businessman who has grinded his ass off for himself, his family, and now this country. A bunch of weak sensitive people now crowd the streets because they don't want change. They've become numb to the truth and twisted by the media. So what if he's a rapist, a sexist a blah blah blah, who fucking gives a shit about that. Do you idiots think that that has anything to do with his economic policies. Well I'll tell you it doesn't. So get the fuck off the streets that someone worked their ass of to pave, clean, and design for you ignorant motherfuckers, get back in your homes and grind your minds. Get over it. Hillary lost boo hoo. go ahead shed some tears, post jack shit on insta or facebook, but come tomorrow ready for change. Im so fucking tired of these pro abortionists, pro lgbtq, illegal immigrants, uneducated protestors, dumbass college kids, stupid black people who think they've got it bad now in the 21st century intead of when they were picking cotton in the 18th People who think he's hitler reincarnated I understand cocaine is a hell of a drug but stay off of it.

"While on other videos we have spent taking shots at one another on the Democratic and Republican side, I think it should be said that this is the man who got elected, the people chose this one as the best to lead the country. I voted for Trump, yes, but why did I vote for him? I believe we needed a businessman to run things for now, not another politician. I'm not going to get into this electoral business because anyone arguing it needs to go back and read up and study as to why it was in place to begin with.

But to this protesting, violence occurring, the vandalism, the claims of him being a racist and is going to deport immigrants. No, he wants to get rid of the illegals and the criminals who bring their filth into this country, that's it. But what I'm seeing here is if the liberals and etc win everything, everyone should bow down and respect the law. However, when you lose, the laws do not apply to you and you're allowed to break people's property and beat them raising all kinds of hell and somehow you think it's fine? Get over yourself. 

Me and a friend, a very good friend of mine, a fellow gamer like I am, he's a liberal and we had a long talk, about the things we need to do together to fix things. See? This hatred and violence is what will keep stalling things. The division needs to be settled. You would not believe how easy things can move forward by sitting down and talking to one another like adults and come up with a plan. While my words mean nothing, I feel that we, as US citizens need to give the man a chance, set aside our differences, come together and we need to figure out how we get out of the hole we're in. 

White, black, brown, yellow or whatever, if you're a US citizen, dammit you're a US citizen and color should make no difference whatsoever. It's time to stop acting like a bunch of brats (Yes, the gloating on the Republican side needs to chill out too). 

Sorry for the wall of text. Just maybe someone seeing this may stop for a moment and think. of what we the people should do.",2016-11-15T06:57:40Z,-1,0,1,0

 home.  You love going to war with smaller countries, and picking on 
people who started nothing with you, but now let there be no illusion

so much how much will you love war when it's American fighting American?
  How much will you love it when American naval ships are sinking 
American naval ships?  How much will you love it when it's American Army
 killing one another?  Can you call yourself a Patriot after you have 
slaughtered your own brethren?  I really want to see that...What will

Its rider had a bow; a crown was given to him, and he came out conquering and to conquer.  When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature call out, “Come!”  And out came another horse, bright red; its rider was permitted to take peace from the earth, so that people would slaughter one another; and he was given a great sword.

"Here is how to make america great again in 5 neutral steps that EVERYONE can do= 
#1  be happy   
#2 do good things (things that benefit everyone, not yourself/clique/class/race/gender/dress size/political party/sexuality etc etc.)
#3  Keep your hopes high.  Trump may be a bigot (which is true in a sense), yadda yadda yadda.  but whether we like it or not against all odds the sun rose on nov 9th.  and will after inauguration day.  If we beat ourselves up, we are doing bad upon ourselves which in turn breaks the almighty cycle of everything.  So instead of going to social media and ranting, congratulate someone, there has to be SOMETHING they have done well.  This will only inspire them to do greater things which will in turn help you out in the long run.
#4  BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING, take a minute and examine why the other side feels the way they do and draw a connection between their problems and their conclusion to their problems, even if you dont agree with it, their problems are entirely relevant to your life.  Theres always a catalyst somewhere whether its a reality tv star being elected president or a fucking comment on youtube, dont let it hurt you. the sun will rise tomorrow.   Like i said, with empathy, neutrality, and humility look at the other persons side.  and take their problems into concern, because if their needs arent met your needs arent met down the line no matter how many years it takes.    
#5  Do good, try hard, dont cut corners, and produce quality every time no matter how hard it is at whatever you do.  it doesnt matter if its a kindergarten soccer game or you are producing the next aaa cultural masterpeice whether that be music, film, game design, etc  to entertain the masses.  If you do a shitty job, even if its easier, somebody somewhere will be affected negatively due to your laziness, it may take a few minutes, or it may take 20 years, no matter what your actions affect yourself.  Karma is a real thing.  It isnt some mystical bs, its called society.  If you dont participate in society, society wont participate in you. 

Thank you for bearing with my rant, and lets make America and all of humanity great again.  Keep in mind I do identify as a liberal, because liberalism by definition is moving forward (I may be wrong but you get the gist), and conservatism literally means the practice of keeping things the same.  While there are things to learn from the past, things will become obscelete whether we like it or not, especially in an era of exponential change (we are going to mars in 10 years for fucks sake this is like scifi.)  So the point is while it is good to look back at the past and observe the lessons to be learned, no matter what time moves forward, and we need to move to keep up with it and keep our eyes ahead.  If we dont, we will be left behind.  No matter who you are you are crucial to society as we know it existing no matter the scope of your influence.  Do great things humanity.

"Does anyone realise that Trump is actually quoting Hillary when he says ""I will be president for all Americans"" ? He also says that ""it is time for America to bind the wounds of division"".  The irony is that Trump's whole campaign has pretty much been built around promoting racism, bigotry, hate, and division, the opposite of what he is saying here.  And the fact that he's praising and quoting a woman he's sworn to put in prison.  Perhaps he's been trolling us the whole time and isn't actually the neo-Hitler he has presented himself as.  Maybe he will actually be a decent president.  Perhaps we ought to give him a chance instead of plotting overthrow him.",2016-11-13T10:24:45Z,1,1,0,0

Nobody thought he had a chance. Then the polls came out and he was crushing all 15 other Republicans. There were still skeptics claiming that you can't trust the polls. I remember people were saying that Clinton or Sanders would have easily stomped Trump. That, it would be an easy victory. Then the primaries happened and Trump was decimating the competition. As candidates started dropping like flies, there were Democrats and Republicans who were vying for a brokered convention so Paul Ryan or John Kasich would be the candidate. And then, Kasich and Cruz dropped out. And thus, Trump was the nominee. The Republican party was so divided, with such a divisive candidate. The Democrats were also divided with another divisive candidate. It appeared that Trump was starting to run his campaign into the ground. His comments about the Muslim veteran, Mike Pence speaking out of his ass making Trump look bad, etc. And then, the audio of his ""locker room talk"" released. That's when everybody counted him out. Clinton was ahead of him in nearly every poll. Some of his supporters were turning against him. They brought it up nonstop in the debates. At this point, the entire media seemed to be against Donald Trump. Every news source was running smear articles on him. Seth Myers, Trevor Noah, and Stephen Colbert incessantly took shits on him. Celebrities like Katy Perry, LeBron James, and Beyonce all endorsed Clinton. FiveThirtyEight said that Hillary had a 70% chance of winning. Nobody thought Trump would win. We were all expecting to finally have our first female president. And then election night happened, and Donald Trump proved all of his naysayers wrong. As ballots started pouring in, his chances drastically went up. Then it happened: PRESIDENT TRUMP! He shocked the world! He did the impossible! And look, I was as much a Trump skeptic as anyone else. I was rooting for Clinton on this one, but when he won not only was I shocked, but I was genuinely impressed and surprisingly proud. Donald Trump is a gift to democracy, and although he didn't win the popular vote, he still represents Democracy at its purest essence. That a billionarie celebrity without any political knowledge has swept the nation and democratically achieved what everyone told him was impossible. No matter what your political rhetoric is, that's a truly incredible underdog story

tl;dr: Nobody wanted Trump to succeed, and he proved everybody wrong. Hate him or love him, you cannot deny that it's a fantastic story.",2016-11-13T00:34:20Z,0,0,0,1

"The very first thing Trump did after having won the election was to betray America. The very first thing he said after getting what he wanted was to honor that Satan worshipping, serial killer and mass murderer Hillary R Clinton. Trump's biggest supporters wouldn't even stand near him at the podium. They must have been horrified at how quickly Trump turned on them and the American people. What's he going to do next, give Hillary a place in his cabinet? For her 30 years of public service?! Books have been written about the evil of the Clinton's. Sometimes the authors paying with their lives to expose the evil of the Clinton crime family and the media. And he honors them? For the sake of unity. Where in Trump's speechs did he promise to unify America with criminals and fools. He promised America justice. And the first thing Trump did was to betray the Americans who trusted him and voted for him. Without justice nothing will change. This man is going to be the next traitor of America. America is about to be schooled on the ""The Art of the Deal"". By its master practioner.",2016-11-13T00:15:56Z,0,0,0,1

"Isn't it fascinating that humans created a system in which people are divided based on groups that we made up which follow a certain mindset that humans also set up. Objectivity is personally my favorite way of living since I don't have any need to choose a side or base my thoughts off of others. I believe that regardless of who won some election for a position of power which is going to last less than a decade, there is no need to attack the other side or attack the system in general. The candidates for this election were bad all around the board. Honestly, unless you are invested in politics, I see it pointless to waste your time on it. If a political decision is being made and it is truly bad, it will naturally be denied. Just remember we have the constitution. If enough people honestly thought Trump would destroy America then I don't think he would either A: have gotten as far as he did, and B: stay in power very long. It is really just a matter of time until we find out whether or not he has the capability to use his knowledge of slander and lying paired with extensive knowledge of how to make money (the dirty way) to boost our economy. In that manner I would also speak the same about Clinton if she were elected, both candidates are liars and that cannot be denied.

"Urgent prophecy revealed. Though this may never fully find the light of day in absolute fulfillment. Mark my words saints. An attempt to steal, take back and destroy a Donald Trumps presidency will be found in our immediate future.

Last night while sharing Presidential perspectives to my audience a phenomenal word was said. A controversy of controversies. This was the word of the LORD: 

America will attempt to recant and dismiss a Donald Trump Presidency. They will desire to derail his crowned connection. Also asking Clinton to conquer, to come back. A petition will be presented. To annul its connection of republican vision. 

December will do this. Pay attention to the attempt as December decodes its dilemma. Though this may never fully find the future, antics and anxiety will push its promise into position. 

Coming to the surface with the attempt to steal or take back what work was created. The democrats will desire to demolish and dethrone the very thing that brought them to their knees. 

Race wars will win as division delights.

It will be refreshing to have finally have a President who actually believes in the values this country was founded on, who believes in American exceptionalism, who believes that Americans should come first in America, and who believes our national sovereignty is paramount and should be protected fiercely. It will be nice to finally have a President who respects and values the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and won't try to gut it by circumventing Congress and legislating through executive orders. No more political correctness bullshit, no more feels before reals, no more sympathizing with terrorists, no more demonizing hard working, law abiding people and trying to restrict their fundamental rights.

Barack and I are planning 'Plan B' to get you out of office in the next two or three years.  Remember, You can't quit now!!!  or we all go down for rigging the election!  Do you understand that?""

Donald gets on stage ""Sorry to keep you waiting, Complicated business, Complicated."".....""I just got off the phone with Secretary Clinton"".....""and hopefully at the end of two years or three years""...{oh, wait!, Term is 4 to 8 years} ""or four years or maybe even eight years""....

They were all in cahoots with each other!!!  Trump family has been very close friends with the Clinton family.  Chelsea and Ivanka stayed close friends during the brutal campaign.  Wikipedia said Donald preferred Bill Clinton vs George Bush in 2015.  When asked for something nice to say about their opponents at the 2nd debate, Hillary said Donalds family.  He raised a good family.

This is the ""I failed at failing"" speech.  The people he is thanking even looks depressed because they won the election...like ""Yeah, we so failed at failing.  Stop thanking us will you"" He fails when he tries to succeed, and he succeeds when he tries to fail.  He sounds like he wants to succeed as president....We will just have to wait and see what happens in 2, 3, 4, or even 8 years.",2016-11-11T21:30:40Z,-1,0,1,0

He knew that WWE america loved to see the polished ""gentlemen"" get smacked with a chair
ala Vince McMahon - Steve Austin. So one by one - Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Hillary Clinton - he laid the smack down on all his rivals. He hit the ratings goldmine.

Now after the dust settles, I hope the real Trump emerges and cleans house. Fix the trade deficits, get the money and special interests out of Washington.

"Okay here we go, I've said this many many times to people since the very beginning of Trump's campaign that Trump is playing his campaign as a business sales program that he will eventually win by boosting attentions from the media and people. But no one believed me but now we can see it from his victory speech:
There are no mentions of ""Crooked Hillary"" or ""Lyin' Ted."" Instead of gloating to Clinton and her supporters, Trump sincerely thanked her for her life of public service. Instead of chastising the Republicans who opposed him in this race, he humbly asked for their assistance. Instead of scapegoating immigrants, he emphasized the need to work together. His victory speech was surprisingly graceful.
Trump won this election by playing three cards:
1.Anti-Immigration Nationalism (to satisfy people who have been affected by the negative outcome of economic globalisation) 
2.Political Incorrectness- As many including me are sick and tired of the political correctness repression preached by the left.
3. Bragging how rich he is-So people believe that he has a lot more autonomies from giant corporations.

But now he is in the office it would be a different story, as his speech already demonstrated.",2016-11-11T18:11:54Z,0,0,0,1

Mind you, Hitler was a (national) socialist, and he spent a lot of money murdering people. Watch this space I guess.... Not that I would have voted for Trump, but in a way I can understand his appeal.... Bear in mind however that infrastructure doesn't appear out of thin air.

"Παπανδρέου Γιώργος : «Οι δημοκρατίες λειτουργούν όταν οι ηγεσίες ακούνε και διαβουλεύονται»

Στην εκλογή Τραμπ αναφέρθηκε σήμερα το απόγευμα ο Πρόεδρος του Κινήματος και της Σοσιαλιστικής Διεθνούς, Γιώργος Α. Παπανδρέου, από το Web Summit, στη Λισαβόνα, μετά από σχετική ερώτηση. Μεταξύ άλλων, τόνισε:

«Οι δημοκρατίες δεν δουλεύουν με την μεταβίβαση της εξουσίας σε έναν, που θεωρεί τον εαυτό του αυθεντία για κάθε τι επιστητό.

Οι δημοκρατίες λειτουργούν όταν οι ηγεσίες ακούνε και διαβουλεύονται, τόσο με ειδικούς όσο και με τους πολίτες, που με τη σειρά τους έχουν την ευθύνη της καθημερινής συμμετοχής· η ψήφος μία φορά κάθε τέσσερα χρόνια δεν αρκεί.»

To web summit είναι το μεγαλύτερο συνεδρίου τεχνολογίας στον κόσμο. Ένας θεσμός που προσελκύει όλες τις μεγάλες startup επιχειρήσεις και αποτελεί σημείο συνάντησης για τους λάτρεις της τεχνολογίας  με επιλεκτική συμμετοχή σημαντικών διεθνών προσωπικοτήτων. Αξίζει να σημειωθεί πως η φετινή χρονιά ήταν η πρώτη που το Web Summit εγκατέλειψε το Δουβλίνο και βρήκε νέο λιμάνι στην πρωτεύουσα της Πορτογαλίας Λισαβόνα.

Η παρουσία και παρέμβαση του πρώην πρωθυπουργού τράβηξε το ενδιαφέρον των συμμετεχόντων οι οποίοι κυριολεκτικά γέμισαν ασφυκτικά το στάδιο(!!) όπου πραγματοποιείται το συνέδριο.",2016-11-11T16:11:27Z,-1,0,1,0

Trumps speech is good, his foreign policy is a policy the United States needs.  The fact that he is getting rid of Obamacare and going to try and drop the price of health insurance to make it cheaper compared to any and all of The democrats proves something is good coming from Trump.

"The world has reached an all time low for the time being, it may get worse, but it will get better!

What YOU feel is part of what everyone feels as a collective. 
Think about every action that you make from now on, the more you keep spreading negativity the more it will spread to those around you and affect them.

Live happily and do good things for you and all those around you, let go of all your grudges and fears. Let go of the past and what does not control your present. Whether you believe it or not but you matter and everything that YOU do matters. 
When you live in the negative you become weak, scared and susceptible to fear, anxiety and control.
When you live in the positive nothing but the well-being of you and those around you matter and you become stronger and help the world move out of this horrible state that we are in now.

This is the least that we can do for this world, so stop the hate and start to love. It's really not as hard as you might think it is.

"Trump is the definition of privileged; he grew up with a golden spoon in a huge ass mansion like many other rich kids. These kids grow up thinking they're somehow better than everyone else and whatever they want they can have - power of money. But the only thing rich people can't buy is time. Death is inevitable and a path we all must take, but this is a hard pill to swallow if you're a rich narcissist who's ""better than everyone else"". Trump is 70 years old. He could have enjoyed his last years on earth peacefully with all the money he has (not saying he will die anytime soon but eventually he will like all of us). But he's desperate to be remembered because he knows he hasn't got much time left, and the best and easiest way to do that is by being president. Whether he is fit/unfit for the role doesn't concern him. He could care less about Americans or what they think of him. He just guaranteed his name in history books and that was his one and only goal, not to help anyone, not to build a wall, not to ""create jobs"" but to be remembered, because deep down he is still the same spoiled brat he always was. I can't imagine what a nightmare he must have been during his teenage years. I actually feel sorry for him. Eventually everyone will be forgotten, even Hitler.",2016-11-11T09:43:35Z,-1,0,1,0

So now the shoe is on the other foot for 4 years or more for the Dems. If you vote for 60 years, I can almost guarantee you won't be happy with ALL the 15 Presidential choices you see. This President-elect hasn't had a day in office yet, but the stock market sure seems to like him. Perhaps we should wait for something actually BAD to happen before we weep too hard. I just wish BOTH campaigns had said more of what THEY wanted to do to go forward than all the negative crap about the other side. It would have been a much more pleasant thing. After the campaign, the work begins.Obama has done many things some people REALLY don't like. Don't be too shocked if they all get undone; it's probably on the agenda and about time. Number one should be OUR best interests, not anything or anyone else's. It might happen and might not. Hope so. I suppose we'll see, just like we have since 1776 every four years. No use crying over things that happen. Deal with them instead. Mr. Trump has done nothing official yet and we still get all the anguish. Republicans had it when Clinton was and Obama were and still are here. We didn't riot or threaten to leave the country. We dealt with reality. All those who DID after this election, just please have some integrity and go for real. Nobody will miss you. You may not be able to make a living wherever you wind up but, keeping it positive, good luck. Really.",2016-11-11T08:56:01Z,-1,0,1,0

I hope all the nonsense stops with the protest of my generation that were the ones who created the hatefulness as madness and created fear,  which we can do nothing about Donald being president because guess what he is our soon to be leader in January. So, I want to ask what is protesting supposed to do? Is it supposed to make Donald Trump sad or make him insecure because the Hispanics and all the races don't like him? I'm sorry but it is really not going to do anything and this is my own opinion and people are probably going to say well ""your white"", guess what I'm not white I'm a Latina who truly believes he will make America Great Again! I know many Clinton supporters will not see eye to eye with me as well as Trump supporters will but the one thing I'm very passionate about Donald is I have hope, faith as well as happiness that what some things he said he will do.

"Trump won the presidency not because of policy, but because he is an outsider to Washington. The American voter (by voting for Trump) essentially said they are tired of the establishment. They are tired or both Republican and Democrat career politicians making moves that benefit only the politicians. They are sick of the government coddling certain groups of people. They are tired of this socialist trend from millennials who want free benefits without having to work for the benefits. They are tired of the government taking money from those who work hard to earn it and give it to those who do not. While the comments Trump made regarding women were ""deplorable"" and unacceptable, his goal (note the word goal) of draining the swamp is incredibly important right now. Like him or hate him, Obama made his decisions based on the interests of millennials (especially the masses of Twitter users) and liberals, not on the needs and wants of ALL Americans. Bush too 8 years ago amassed to the same thing. Hillary Clinton was essentially the ""establishment party"" and would have amounted to another 4 years of a career politician in office, with her interests before the country's. While some of trump's stances (i.e. The wall) are unattainable, I believe his ultimate goal of ""draining the swamp"" will happen, be it good or bad. Also, Hillary was plagued by both the Benghazi scandal and the email scandal. Criminal or not, both of these issues were a factor (maybe the most decisive ones) in deciding the president. Feel free to agree or disagree in your replies, but I tried hard not to include race (because when race is brought up, everyone loses and nobody is right), so if possible please try not to bring up race",2016-11-11T06:20:37Z,-1,0,1,0

"Had I been old enough to vote in this election, Clinton would have gotten my support.  I don't identify with a particular party, but rather with  individual ideas.  Throughout this heated campaign, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have said some pretty controversial things.  But what people are failing to understand is that is a natural consequence of politics.  Clinton and Trump may be two of the most skilled campaigners this country has ever seen.  They have both shown they are worthy of running the country.  
      In this speech, I was particularly surprised by Donald Trump's Presidential attitude that drastically contrasted with his campaigning attitude.  His demeanor probably caught his hardcore supporters off guard.  No, there will be no wall.  No, Hillary is not going to prison.  No, Trump is not going to deport EVERY undocumented immigrant.  Those claims are just the glitter on Trump's campaign that easily catch our eye.  
      But what CAN we expect from a Trump presidency with a Republican House, Senate and possibly Judiciary?  I don't know.  Our politicians in Washington have proven time and time again that passing game-changing legislation is near impossible.  But who knows what they'll accomplish in the coming years. 
      This is not the end of the world as many people are making it seem.  Sure, we can expect to see change of some kind.  But if Trump continues the demeanor he displayed here, I can't imagine the country plunging into chaos like it has the past few days.  
      Like I said, I did not support Donald Trump ever during this election, but despite that fact, I'm looking to future with a positive attitude eager to see what President-elect Trump can do for this great country.",2016-11-11T04:39:57Z,1,1,0,0

"The Great American lies: Half-truth election. America needs a new system. The Truth is not left nor right.
 

 With all elections, there will be winners and losers; the biggest loser
 of this election is the democratic process, and the great American lie,
 ""All votes count"".
 
 Donald Trump, finishing second, with 47.57% of the popular vote, becomes Americans 45th President, winning 306 Electoral seats.
 

 Hillary Clinton, finishes first with 47.61% of the popular vote, 
getting only 232 electoral votes, gets no representation in this 
republic,
 
 The other party leaders, 4.82% popular vote, and 0 Electoral Votes, like Hillary Clinton gets no representation.
 
 No one person will probably get a majority, definitely not a major majority which is 75% plus one.
 
 So what about the majority of people who did not vote for the winner ?
 

 So why not allow the top three to form the oval office and have each 
winner have a weighted vote at the table; it could bring some balance to
 the table, and more accountability, remember America is suppose to be a
 democracy, not a dictatorship.
 
 Regardless of who wins, America
 should clean up the debris of a series of 'devils truths', or 
'half-truths' that are like a cancer in America.
 
 If we want to 
arrive at a democracy, then this American system, (*Canada's system 
fairs no better) is not democratic. Look at the conclusion. The winner, 
in popularity votes, actually loses based on the electoral seat count. 
The majority of American voters are not represented by the new 
President.
 
 I would blame the former Presidents, who while in 
power, had the ability to make the system democratic, especially the 
last Democratic leader.
 
 However we should also take this 
opportunity to expose some of the other American lies, based on the 
'white-lies' of the democratic Party leader, Ms. Hillary Clinton.
 
 Ms. Hillary Clinton has lied with lies, however she also lies with truths; how can that be ?
 
 Half-truth. 1.
 Women's did not vote. Well before the first world war, women and men did not vote.
 
 Half-truths 2
 We are all equal. Literal half-truth of the truth, 'we are all equal before the law, or God'. We are not all equal in the law.
 
 Half-truth 3
 Women's income verses men's income. Half-truth logic, that ignores the shared incomes of family, of husband and wives.
 
 Half-truth 4
 Abortion is based on a half-truth, a half-truth lie. There are two heart-beats, two lives, not a women's choice OVER H ER BODY.
 
 Half-truths5

 Stop violence against women, ignores the many abuses of women, of men, 
of children and the unborn, for men and women DON'T grow on a tree.
 

 Ms. Hillary Clinton;s half-truths, reflect the divisive truths of 
cult-feminists, and the deception of Adam and Eve; how bizarre.
 

 There are, I am sure a great many other half-truths that America must 
clean up, including correcting t he definition of 'half-truths'; 
mysteriously it is wrong.
 
 With two top candidates splitting the
 vote, it appears America will fall victim to a half-truth election, 
prompting some of us to suggest that America, and Canada, needs a new 
political system, whereby 'the people' control their government, not a 
party, not a leader, not one color of The Truth. Why not elect three 
people to the oval office, each with a weighted vote ?
 
 It would seem, that ever since the First World War, politics has been divided between left and right, when in fact, it is both.
 

 There are more democratic systems in the world, and the one in 
Switzerland is better, if you think that democracies are the ideal; 
remember sometimes even the majority get it wrong.
 
 If something is not working properly, or can be made better than fix it; Switzerland has a better system.
 
 Why not elect at least three position to the oval office, and each carries a weighted vote, based on voter support ?
 

 Regardless of whom you voted for, the American system is not a high 
quality democratic system, with the majority of people, who voted not 
being represented in the results; Switzerland has a better system.
 

 There is good, better and best, the American system is good, the 
Canadian system is poorer; both could use a better more democratic 
system, with the understanding that even the majority can be wrong.
 
 America, and Americans have to get closer to THE TRUTH.

Trump now can start DEFINING how he will achieve his VAGUE promises for healthcare for all, greatness, Jobs, Infrastructure, and strength.  THE ONLY THING TRUMP HAS GOING FOR HIM IS THAT THE DEMS SOLVED THE PROBLEMS AFTER THE LAST REPUBLICAN, AND AS ALWAYS SEEMS TO HAPPEN IN THE PAST 50 YEARS, THE DEMS BALANCE AND CORRECT MAJOR WAR SPENDING, deficits and debts that conservatives make, and hand over to the next, conservative administration an improved fiscal situation, as usual, and repubs take it as license to do it all over again.  BUT, this time it is much more dangerous.  The Congressional conservatives blocked a legit , moderate nominee to the supreme court (only b/c they thought they were finally done as they should be - irresponsible children that they are).  NOW, the conservatives have all branches and will reshape the govt.  The facts are, these repub lawmakers who blocked the vote on Obama's appointee are lawmakers who should all be impeached for not upholding their oath. Obama's nomination was well in advance of the historical lame duck period. If that does not happen, EVERY DEM left in this GOVT should BLOCK EVERY conservative agenda item in the next term if it doesn't make bipartisan sense.  The Repubs have set that obstructionist precedent and it is now time to BLOCK and FILIBUSTER EVERYTHING that is not a truly moderate piece of legislation from Trump and the repubs. If repubs can get away with torturing Obama for eight years to achieve his agenda (and OBAMA greatly improved the fiscal situation for ALL) DEMS should put it all out and pull it all out, & risk destroying their party to radicalism b/c repubs have shown and proven their is no loyalty to the USA, rather the way to victory is only TO REJECT ANY AND ALL COOPERATION with the oppositional party.

"Trump's 3 most important voter demographics were as follows, in order:
Evangelical Protestants,
Men without high school education,
Men without college education.    (I'm not kidding, it's a fact. 90% of 
those with a post-graduate education voted for Hilary - not because she 
was a good candidate, but because she wasn't a narcissist with a 
penchant for authoritarian policy..)

*""An educated citizenry is a vital requisite for our survival as a free 
people.""* - Thomas Jefferson

*""If a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of 
civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.""*

*""Convinced that the people are the only safe depositories of their own 
liberty, and that they are not safe unless enlightened to a certain degree, I
 have looked on our present state of liberty as a short-lived possession unless the mass
 of the people could be informed to a certain degree.""*

*""Above all things I hope the education of the common people will be 
attended to, convinced that on their good sense we may rely with the most 
security for the preservation of a due degree of liberty.""*

*""The most effectual means of preventing [the perversion of power into 
tyranny are] to illuminate, as far as practicable, the minds of the people at 
large, and more especially to give them knowledge of those facts which history 
exhibits, that possessed thereby of the experience of other ages and countries, they may be 
enabled to know ambition under all its shapes, and prompt to exert their natural

"Hillary Clinton supporters are so irrational. they have no clue of what Hillary is. please do your research.
she a shady politician with a dark history. From first lady to secretary of state, she has done immense damage to the world.
back in the day with bin laden and now Isis. from Iraq war to chaos in the middle east, she can be directly blamed for those results. she not only supported such thing but also indirectly funded terrorism, to create chaos  in order to restrain Russia. and now it's getting out of ""their"" control that resulted in many people getting killed. she is a politician and politicians act politically, these people would act accordingly to those elites in order to obtain power. US government is very corrupted and we aren't exactly a democratic  country. voting is a manipulation, this country is controlled by the elites and so is Hillary. most people don't understand but please understand this, Hillary is a war criminal. Compare that to nine rape charge.

"I will say I respect and am happy to be in a country that allows all its’ people to be heard and I understand that that can also mean not always getting what we wish for at times but in light of this, democracy is fair but to a point. On Tuesday, it went beyond that point. We voted against our better interest whether you agree with me or not, it’s not just an opinion, it’s a fact. There should be regulations about who is qualified to vote for this very critical position, our citizens need to be educated enough to make a reasonable, informed choice. Period. Also, stiffer regulations on WHO is qualified to run in a political race. It cannot, under any circumstances be just anyone, just like in any job, you must prove you have the necessary skills, experience, and intellect to do a sufficient job before hire. And last but certainly not least, mandatory psychological testing. If you’re a potential presidential candidate, it should be a non-negotiable process. This needs to be taken with the utter most caution and responsibility. It just does, I feel such heartache for my country but I will stand by it in-spite of this reckless outcome. We must continue to fight for what’s right, for equality, the environment, women, children, people of color, the poor, education, balance of power among the wealthy especially those with reckless intents. We truly must stand for these things now more than ever before. The person who loses is the one who stops fighting.",2016-11-11T00:20:32Z,0,0,0,1
"Trump isn't perfect. And I have no great liking for him as a person. I 
supported Gary, not Trump. I don't even think he's a true conservative. I
 think he simply wanted to be able to brag about being president.

But if I can trust Trump to do one thing, it's to give the people who 
elected him what they wanted. And what the 
libertarians/independants/conservatives in this country want right now, 
is secured borders, no more national debt, a justice administration that
 enforces the law, and the freedom to practice their religion without 
being sued.

He'll give us that. And we'll elect him again. 8 years. Calling it now.

Bet you feel bad about crying wolf on McCain and Romney now, huh? 
Demonizing them? No no one listened to you when there was a real threat 
to the progressive left. Romney and McCain were actually fairly moderate
 candidates who didn't mind reaching across the aisle. Bet you wish you 
had treated them better.

Now you have Trump. And he'll give us everything we wanted. The USA is 
our for the next half century. We'll own the supreme court. You will not
 demolish the second amendment. You will watch as our borders are locked
 down, terrorists are blocked from entering, and illegals are deported. 
And you will watch as only immigrants who have the HONOR to go through 
the system like everyone else are rewarded with the PRIVILEGE of 
citizenship. You will watch as the rights of Christians to hold true to 
their beliefs are protected. And you will watch as the national debt 
begins to heal, and you will watch as the globalization of America 
stops. And we put America first again.

I don't like Trump. But I believe he'll give the right what we want. 
Even if he is a buffoon, a clown, and a  scoundrel.

Look, you fucking idiots, the truth of the matter is that all of you, and I mean every one of you, is an irrational, impressionable, naive, uninformed, feeble minded DUMBASS devoid of critical thinking ability who absolutely loves getting spoon-fed by the mainstream media. You are an intellectual infant and brainwashed. You give into peer pressure. You have no spine and no willigness to learn and no curious bone in your body. You'd rather have your information served on a silver platter by whoever you may come across.

Enough with this bullshit already. Do your OWN, INDEPENDENT research. Stop trusting the mainstream media so blindly. Stop trusting your indoctrinated, ignorant friends about political issues or any issues with depth for that matter. Trump is NOT what you think he is and what they say he is.

Yet, as you grow older, you realize you have to wait, since a lot of good AND bad can come out of patience, which is why I give chances. Right now, I don't want him as my president, as our leader to look up to, but we have to wait. I don't wish death upon him, unlike most radical democrats, but I just have nothing to like about him.

"I'm surprised at the crowd's reaction when Trump is talking about Clinton. Very respectful. Even back in '08 I remember McCain's supporters were harshly booing at his concession speech when he brought up Obama. 

My last hope, the emergency exit if you will, throughout almost all of Donald Trump's candidacy for president has been that the extremely racist, bigoted and sexist things that he was saying were for show, to incite his supporters, and to get media attention.
Now that he's been elected, I am desperately doubling down on that hope. Between his victory speech and his meeting with Obama today, there's a tiny spark there maybe to go atop the kindling of his comments from years ago on being pro-choice and relatively moderate in general.

I respect Obama's point that I may not have wanted Trump to be my president, but now that he is, I have to hope for his success.

I'm not convinced yet, but what do we have if not hope?",2016-11-10T22:23:23Z,1,1,0,0

"Congratulations to our new President.  I hope you realize, Mr. President, that part of your victory, if not a major part, is the people's frustration with Mr. Obama cuddling policies and actions  towards the muslim invasion and infiltration of top government positions. The major part was Hilary's bare faced lying on television about her part in the Benghazi tragedy and her email scandals showing irresponsibility and callous carelessness on matters of national security. Thanks to modern communications technology and the investigative efforts of our tv journalists and reporters, and thanks to our congress for actively pursuing the questionable acts of everyone involved and implicated with Hilary's criminal  attempts at cover ups, the American people are given up to the minute information of what is happening beautifully timed before the elections. And now the people has handed  down its  verdict - by making Mr. Trump our new President.",2016-11-10T21:33:07Z,1,1,0,0

"This election will truly go down in the history books as tjhe most pivotal election in modern times in both substance and legitimate change where the silent majority finally awoke from a long nap and decided it was time to retake control of our government while placing the globalists on notice that their improprieties will no longer be acceptable in this country. It is time America starts conducting its business for Americans, not some globalist agenda which has cost uis our industrial base, and moral high ground in the world. The self serving interests in DC might want to consider packing now. There is no place for the enemies of the American dream in this country further. Whether foreign or domestic, the enemies of American sovereignty unless they are completely without the ability to reason must know the American people have had enough. I sincerely hope Mr. Trump fulfills his stated plan for the first 100 days in office, and immediately begins cleaning out those judges and other officials that have been both legislating from the bench and ignoring the constitutional limits on government intrusion into the lives of the citizenry. For those here illegally, I strongly suggest you find a means to become legal and that involves showing the same respect for the stars and stripes and  American culture (the big melting pot). Those here illegally  involved in criminal activities and civil disturbances that are meant to disrupt our society should count on going home very very soon. No reasonable human on this planet can expect to be welcomed in a country while attempting to tear it and its culture down. In other words to if you desire to be American it is not conducive to your success to behave in a violent or criminal manner waving a Mexican flag and demanding change. If you desire change, get legal and trade out that Mexican flag for the Stars and Stripes lest you find yourself no longer welcome in this country. And for the Marxists running around acting like animals carrying the hammer  and  sickle often accompanied by  the molly coddled 'entitled' SJWs and deviates, Luciferians, and other dark beliefs count your blessings. If we were the political system you seem to endorse and idolize, you would already have been disappeared or jailed. If you desire something more to your lives, what is required is a little hard work and although it is easier to take what someone else has worked for then working for it yourself chances are it is not obtainable without some personal effort.

My feeling is the time has come to expect the best. We need to manage our emotions as well, especially the anger and fear he has generated. I believe we need to be courageous.

"Clinton supporters...act civil, because they KNEW Hillary was going to win, but when they actually lose...they riot, and cause all sorts of mayhem in their respective cities. Which is funny, because in almost every city they are rioting and causing trouble are cities that supported Hillary. So they are literally rioting and destroying things...because that is how liberals are. They expect everything to be handed to them, and when it isn't they react violently. I know there are some liberals out there that are only being passive aggressive, but still...man up and accept it. I have yet to see a liberal just accept the fact that Trump is president without a snide remark. Hillary has committed treason and she might as well have killed the Americans in Benghazi herself. America made the right choice...but that doesn't mean I like it anymore than most people.",2016-11-10T20:44:36Z,-1,0,1,0

"Congratulations to Donald Trump. I may not be American (I'm British) and you may not be my favourite person, but I am glad that the Clinton's will not occupy The White House. I do not want to live in a polically correct world, where people like me (a straight, white male) are going to be neglected simply because the way I was born. People who are the opposite may complain that whilst Trump is president, then they will be essentially done for. Trump explicitally said that he would protect the LGBTQ community and let's face it, the Mexicans are NOT paying for that wall. Heck, there may not even be a wall at all. I may have been a publicity stunt. He has said some questionable things that I cannot defend, but I think people should give Trump 6-12 months before writing him off. He's not gonna be in The White House for two months and yet people are already lighting bonfires and protesting with some really ridiculous chants. The moral of the story: See what happens for January onwards before bitching and moaning. If are one of the many people who have bitched and moaned already, then you are the reason that you have a president Trump. You brought this on yourself unintentionally. There's nothing you can do now. That's life I'm afraid. Doing silly protests ain't gonna change nothing. You are just gonna look childish. Trump has been getting on with Obama as of late, so things are looking positive. This speech was brilliant. It was sincere and really kind and respectful. So keep your head up America. Britain loves you more than you know. God bless America. xx",2016-11-10T20:34:21Z,1,1,0,0

"The Love Life Of An Asian Guy

Have you all read this shit?

This is pretty fucking terrifying.
His plan starts off moderate, but quickly descends into a Tim Burton nightmare of conservative bullshit. Given the Republican's control over The House and The Senate, these could easily happen...

Here's what I found:

* SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward
(Will tear through Indigenous neighborhoods and displace families)
* SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States
(He's looking for Scalia pt.2)
* FOURTH, begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won't take them back
(We could see millions of Americans forced out of this country...)
7. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. 
(A plan that would put us billions of dollars in debt. Mexico already said they wouldn't pay a cent)
8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars.
(He's looking to enact stop-and-frisk nationwide. This will have unfathomable repercussions for Black and Brown people)

Even Jimmy Kimmel did a bit about this on his show, noting that the kid seemed completely unimpressed by the whole affair, as if he was merely PO'd that he will have to move to D.C. away from all his friends.

"Anyone that knows me, knows I like to mind my own business when it comes to politics. I'm not very vocal, and I let people have their own views, but I'm sick and tired of how people are acting after this election. It's so funny really. There were no violent riots or protests from conservatives when Obama got in 8 years ago, yet somehow, when Trump gets in, the radical liberals think it's okay to smash in police cars and burn their cities. Either people don't understand how democracy works, or they're just entitled little brats. I'm all for peaceful protests (after all, freedom of assembly is a democratic principle), but that hasn't been what's happening. I'm not American, but this election has showed me that a lot of liberals don't like democracy; and don't get me wrong, I don't support Trump, but I certainly don't support Hilary either. (I don't want this to be a blanket statement either; obviously there are many radicals in both camps, as well as many people willing to give either candidate a chance had they won). This is democracy, the people vote, and the majority wins. The best part? If he turns out to be a terrible leader then just vote him out in the next election. If liberals and democrats don't like democracy, then they can feel free to move to Syria or North Korea and see how dictatorships work. *mic drop*",2016-11-10T14:51:03Z,-1,0,1,0
"so what are you gonna do if another state or union becomes greater then USA? 
America is a part of the world and not a union nor nation by the way..

Making America great would mean to also make latin-America great..

And why did you stop inviting states to you union over there..? there are a lot more then 52 states in America..
the act of stopping the invitations to join the United states of America was probably the poisoned needle that stung you and you'r starting to feel the consequences of now..

If the president had less Power then cannada and latin would most likely be part of USA, and USE would be equally more powerfull.

the only problem I had with President elect Trump speech is what the speech writers had him say regarding Hillary. He should have stopped when she said that she had for a very hard race. How in the world could anyone believe his comment about what a great service she had provided for this country. That is totally wrong when you see all of the corruption and hardship she brought to the people of this country. Did the speech writer take a drug to be able to write that coming from the Republican Party is this the beginning of them trying to make him part of the Old Guard or two play nice mr. Trump speech was wonderful especially when he was not reading the teleprompter when he had lived. But this sentence about her great service was definitely something this week's writers put in and mr. Trump should not have said it.,2016-11-10T13:53:12Z,1,1,0,0

People need to stop crying regarding Hilary winning the popular vote. This is not how his campaign was run. If he wanted to win popular vote he would have run his campaign completely different (i.e he would've gone to democratic states to gain individual votes). If people had a problem with the electoral college why didn't they speak about it before the election? Oh wait because they're sore losersP.s I live in NY and have atleast 20 friends who would've voted for trump however due to the fact that NY is Democratic they didn't bother because they knew he wouldn't win the electoral college. Same thing in California. So really unless you start off an election based on popular votes you can never really know who's going to win popular vote.,2016-11-10T13:18:52Z,0,0,0,1

And, his campaign was one of the most negative and nastiest in electoral politics. That said, I believe we should all get a grip, take a deep breath, have a drink or two, and congratulate the man for his victory. I do believe deep down that this is good, very good. He pissed of the old guard, insulted a few foreign leaders, took issue with the terrible trade deals like NAFTA and TPP, and has shaken up the system in ways I never thought I'd see in my lifetime (and pissed off the Bushes, what a gift!). The CFR and the Trilateral Commission and the Bilderbergs and their NWO conspiracy the Rockefellers cooked up years ago could be a thing of the past, we hope, and maybe, just maybe, we will be a better and stronger country for it.

"I've never been more furious at the democratic party.

They threw this entire election, plain and simple.

From the start they made sure it was Hilary on the ticket despite the overwhelming evidence that she was unelectable.

Then they all she did was say ""This historic time in history!"" while calling Trump sexist for implying that she was using the ""woman card"" and very clearly playing the ""woman card"".

Meanwhile their attitude about all of her scandals were ""It doesn't matter"" and ""This is just a smear campaign"". Well it WAS a smear campaign and it WORKED. Rather or not you think it's fair it destroyed her chances and they just ignored it. Then all it took was some republican at the FBI to reopen the case at the right time.

Lastly they should have NEVER did this whole ""You go low, I go high"" bit. Trump won because people are bored and they wanted a spectacle. What she should have done was eviscerate him in a long rant pointing out each and every fucked up thing around him. She should have just slammed him, period.

Well, congratulations Democrats! You're so smart, you lost again! And it's everyone else's fault, right?

And surely all the dirty dealings that you pretend aren't issues like fixing the nomination, having a clear media bias, and slanting polls to make it sound like she already won. Surely NONE of that contributed to your loss.

Maybe next time don't smirk at everything with an air of superiority, Hilary. Or, you know, give it up because YOU CAN'T WIN THE PRESIDENCY!

But thanks, I do so appreciate electing a megalomaniac pretend billionaire sue happy sexist racist homophobic rapist reality tv star who apparently needs to be in Pizza Hut commercials despite being a supposed billionaire.

It's the people that voted for him that I'm terrified of. Look at it this way. All the bullshit Trump said and all the horrible things he said he will do, he probably didn't even mean it. He just did it to stand out from the rest. But his supporters...took it seriously. They voted for that ""bullshit"" and all those ""horrible things"", thinking Trump was serious when he said all that.

"Trump is going to save free speech and true democracy. No more leftist political correctness and no more SJW's. No more tiranny by the elitists. He is going to drain the swamp and turn around the destruction by cultural marxism that has been undermining the core values, common decency and common sense of a free society for decades. But he can't do that by himself. It is the people themselves that will have to turn their country around to freedom again.  But he has given hope to those who had already given up that this can actually be done. And his influence is spreading worldwide. ISIS will be dealt with now. Syria will have peace again. No more war mongering with Putin. Hopefully this will put even an end to the sefdestruction of Europe and stop the implementation of the Kouwenhoven Calergi plan. We have the same problems over here and the same swamp to drain and the same leftist windmills to fight. Trump has just proven that it can be done. He has proven there is a silent majority of good people that have been gagged by the elites but who will stand up if they know someone has their back. Trump has been the spokesman of the countermovement against those that are always shouting racist to shut people up and he has let the djinny out of the bottle.",2016-11-10T08:56:02Z,-1,0,1,0

But now that I've watched it and listened to his first speech as our new President-Elect, I can honestly say that I now believe he will be a wonderful President.  I was an Apprentice and Celebrity Apprentice fan for many years.  The most fascinating part of the show for me was the board room and how Mr. Trump spoke and handled the deliberations.  I was truly addicted to that show (I re-watched  taped episodes during and after each season).  But when I heard Mr. Trump speak during the campaign, I was very confused and disappointed.  However tonight, as I listen to him speak, I heard the intelligent and inclusive person I heard in the Boardroom.  His speech deeply touched my heart.  I look forward to the upcoming Presidential Inauguration.  I wish I could afford to be there in person to meet and congratulate him and his family personally.  I also look forward to being the recipient of his successful Presidency.  God Bless America and the Trump ohana.",2016-11-10T08:50:47Z,1,1,0,0

"The beginning of the end of the light of the light of nations for behold darkness has hid within the light to make darkness like light and light like darkness. How apparently obvious how one of the Heads Of The Dragon would play such a paradoxical song by the Rolling Stones, ""You Can't Get What You Want"". The Age Of Aquarius has stagnated and the Age Of Capricorn has commenced...for the sons of God where NOT able to bind the chains of Satan NO LONGER according to the Book Of Revelation (REVELATION 20:1-3) for the 1000 Millennia is coming to a closing chapter. What you Americans claim Freedom Of Speech, Of the Press and the very little little pesky Bill Of Rights that YOU in vain try to uphold will commencfully be subsided and suppressed by the beginnig of this very first Agent. Because your nation is greedy of gain, has continuously indulged in selfishness, and are followers of wealth, the laws of old, and HAS NOT LOOKED upon the Lord our God AS YOU LOOK UPON YOURSELFS IN LOVE, IN UNDERSTANDING, IN GRACE, IN WISDOM (KNOWLEDGE), IN UNITY. So shall one of the Agents of the Great Dragon shall have power and authority over its own people to be of a double mind. To begin to establish the seeds of blasphemy, false knowledge, and of false doctorine and to unite with the other Dragons (other nations) against the coming of Our Christ...The New World Order must be first established and the seeds of evil will take root over the world. The very little individual freedoms and individualized beliefs and individualized characters that you have enjoyed will be replaced by a number, your ability to perform as a by-product for his Agent for the sake of your family (and for His of course), and the beginning and the waning of your privacies and the publication of your identities. Your nation will be divided and you will fight amongst YOURSELFS. For the Age Of Capricorn knocks suddenly and the Age Of Aquarius drastically closes and a New World and a New Age will be upon the face of man in the eyes of God.

""Because I have called, and ye refused; I have streched out my hand, and NO MAN regarded; 
But ye have set a naught all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;
When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you
Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
For that they hated (true) knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:
Therefore shall they eat the fruit of THEIR OWN WAY, and be filled with THIER OWN DEVICES""

"Ok so Trump finally won. Ok Trump supporters you got what you wanted. That doesn't mean you can go around telling black people, gay people, muslim people etc to leave or die. 
Seriously if Trump wanted to turn Americans against each other like Zemo did with Captain America and Iron Man...he succeeded. Trump speaks of taking down ISIS, yet the only thing that's gonna be taken down is America's unity. You're going to have a surge of the supporters going around making threats that concern everyone. Students in schools are becoming SO SCARED of their surroundings because they're afraid of what the supporters will do...and these supporters believe they can get away with it because Trump is the president.
I believe ISIS is a big concern yes, but at this rate, what I am more concerned about is can he unite the people of america? It's Trump supporters vs Anti Trump supporters, and as far as I've seen, Trump supporters are pretty much giving people that Trump has targeted a living nightmare.",2016-11-10T06:14:30Z,1,1,0,0

And many Germans did think that this man was ""god sent"" to ""save Germany"", and all he did was destroying his land and causing immense pain for the whole world.
Well, I really hope for all of us that a President Trump will not go this far. But there´s an old saying: ""Who sows the wind will reap storm"". And a campaign that is based on so much hate is much more than just ""wind"". So beware of the storm, Mr. President-Elect!",2016-11-10T05:31:54Z,0,0,0,1

Impressive the future seems brighter then I thought it was this morning and am looking forward to seeing what Donald is capable of.

He needs to realize that if he's going to be president to democrats and other people who did not support him he can not be as radical, racist, sexist, homophobic, etc as he is. This country is a very big country with many different views, opinions, ideas, and people so he needs to be more open and willing to surround himself with people who don't have the same views as him. Compromise is key in this situation. I honestly believe he is too close minded to lead this country but we will see what happens.",2016-11-10T05:18:45Z,1,1,0,0

Reading this comment section. I've seen two things. People coming together and congratulating each other and hoping for the best. And then sore winners. To sore winners calm down. You didn't win a war. You didn't solve world peace. All you did was put your vote in a ballot box for the person you wanted in office. And to those on who are accepting victory graciously and are coming together with those who have lost. I would like to personally thank you for being a respectful American citizen.

"I seem to remember when President Obama took office that yes he got his fair share of hatred just like Trump is getting now, but he said something that I think everyone needs to remember. In this country, there are no red states, or blue states, we are and always will be the united states of America. I believe that, now with Trump in office we can become better allies with Russia, and like Regan I think he'll be able to fix our economy. Do I agree with some of the things he has said, the answer is truly a no. I do however have to respect the fact that he did not shy away and kept to his reckless nature that got him where he is now. He's a champion of the common man, the suburban and rural population sees something in him that's been lacking in previous candidates. The republican party has a chance to make something great happen, when Abraham Lincoln was able to sign the Abolishment of Slavery, it was when his party had more chairs then the other party at the time and he was able to work with the party and get the constitutional law passed. Trump has a background, and its a bit of a worry just what he will and won't do when in office, but the pieces are all there for change to happen. For once, change to happen. The house is not divided, the republican party holds the Senate, and holds the house, the president is republican, and I fully believe that with those elements combined, America can make itself born again. Were not simple minded anymore,  there is no black or white unless you look at it that way, there is no division in this country between us American Citizens that is not made unless we do it. We have to unify and agree, that while we may not all get exactly what we want, what's best is what can be done to make our whole country great again. We have that ability, and when we are great we can extend our arm out and help those once more. Imagine America as a potato farm during the great famine, one of the only potato farms that did not get hit by the crop disease. You have those in harder conditions needing food to survive, and you have to choose who lives and who dies of starvation, and its a tough choice to make. For the current time the ones who grow and work the fields were given less then those who did not, another similar comparison would be to say that the working class is the hands and feet of the country, and without hands and without feet you cannot function unless others help you. We must unify and work under one voice, move forward and be stronger, and make America great again.",2016-11-10T03:11:23Z,1,1,0,0

But you can Google it on your own free time. On the other hand, Trump might be a racist or whatever but he is not a criminal. He wants to end the present corruption in the government. He doesn't have any political experience but he is going to have advisers to help him out. One important thing is that he wants to work out things with Russia so we don't live under the threat of nuclear war. He wants to get rid of illegal people living in the United States. He is right about that too. There are laws that have to be respected. If he is a racist or not, it wont affect you. Dont worry about it.

People need to give him a break and at least give a chance that he worked hard for..its been decided now people need to stop crying and move on or move to Canada or where ever it is you feel safe no one is stopping you. All the things he said in this video that he wants to do for our country are good and you are ignorant if you think otherwise. Another thing people are overlooking is what the rest of the world thinks about trump and im mainly talking about Russia. We have not had the best relationship with Russia here lately. The way things have been in Russia with there conflicts with other countries and the thought that ww3 might happen because of them we dont want to be there enemy. Putin already doesnt like Obama and he probably wouldnt have been the best of friends with Hilary either but at least he likes Trump which is a good thing and Putin said he is even willing to completely try and get back on good terms with the usa and get rid of tension we have with each other. In the end in its all said and done and he is going to have his chance to make the country better and hopefully a lot of the good things he wants to will get done and everybody will look back and feel bad for doubting him.,2016-11-10T02:54:41Z,-1,0,1,0

"So this man wants to ""bind the wounds of division"" meaning he's going to unite all groups of people correct? Tbh at first I was worried about Trump deporting people but I realized he simply can't do that unless he wants America to crumble economically. The more I'm starting to see other people's perspectives the more I'm starting to feel less stressed about his presidency. Only problem I have is how this man feels about different races in America. If he is or at least will become a good president he shouldn't have any problem with them since America is literally a place where all races can come together hence ""The United States"".

Donald has definitely toned down for the moment in this speech i guess kellyann and some of his crew told him to, just to appease the american voter but i have a feeling we will see the old angry donald again and that sime of his old rigid beliefs that he expressed will come to light.

"Trump -- Called some woman fat and made some other ""Private"" comments which offended some women and made a few mistakes when speaking which meant that his ideas came out wrong.

Hillary -- Deleted 33,000 emails which were sent on a private server, laughed during the Benghazi trial, Lied to America about many many things, she was in office for 46 years and accomplished nothing, voluntarily defended a rapist and laughed at the victims and tried to cover it up, called black people super predators, called trump supporters dumb, says she is part of the middle class but wears $12,000 dress to an event, called the secret service a bunch of as*ho*es, put down stay at home mums and she has done so much more.

But yet people are upset that Trump won --- Don't listen to the media. Do your own research",2016-11-10T01:41:34Z,0,0,0,1

"TO ALL CLINTON SUPPORTERS WHO RIOTED IN DISAPPROVAL- Ok, you've had your rant, you got it out of your system (acting like a bunch of apes out of control and spoiled brats, but I digress). Now, you have options:
1.  Get some rest, but on your big boy or girl pants tomorrow, take a deep breath and go get a job or go back to school. We had to deal with your absolute crap for 8 years and we acted sane; do the same. 
2.  IF YOU CANNOT OR DO NOT WISH TO COMPLY WITH #1, move back in with your parents (or continue living with your parents) and hopefully they can take care of you. You've had 8 years of laziness and free hand-outs, your time is over. The party was eventually going to end. 
3.  IF YOU CANNOT DO OR DO NOT WISH TO COMPLY WITH #1 or #2; get out of our country. 

See, Republicans are reasonable: we give options. But, I did not serve my country and watch fellow brothers die protecting your right to shove gay marriage and gay tolerance down MY throats, forcing my church to close or COMPLY WITH in-Godly marriage ceremonies or be sued. I did not defend you right to sue bakers who would not bake a wedding cake for your wedding. There is no such thing as separation of church and state-look it up. Not in our constitution, Declaration of Independence, bill of rights. Not there. I should be able to practice my faith without government interference which your gay referendum is violating my rights. And I definitely did not serve my country so you could shout racism and riot when you're the racists for bringing color into any situation. And I didn't defend this country so when you liberals don't get your way, you feel like you can reenact The Walking Dead and lie on streets, moan and hiss. In combative situations, go ahead and do that-you just make yourself an easier target and I don't want to worry about you running up and hugging the first ISIS troops. That's fine just duck because I will be aiming.",2016-11-10T01:35:45Z,1,1,0,0

"Liberals are so desperate... they try to suck as many colored tits and cocks so they don't feel ''racist'', fascist, homophobic or xenophobic. They say:

- Trump will cause WW3 / Hillary actually admitted a possible conflict with Russia and Iran during her reign as president (Something all ''liberals'' like to pass aside).
- Clinton has a criminal passed during her stay in the White House, a lot of people do not know about (millennials).
- Trump has a lot of national, patriotic and middle-class people behind him, while Clinton has Communist, Cultural Marxist, Liberal, LGBT, Anarchistic, Anti-white (reversed nazi's) and poor colored people behind her. 
- Clinton is praised by SJW's and liberal college students. while they don't know half the fact about her role against the Afro-American community, her stance against homosexuality and hostile trade pacts in the past.
- Hillary has officially been recorded lying by showing footage of past recordings, while stating the reversed truth (like the sniper incident...)
- Hillary might be involved in one of the biggest scandals ever done to a nation (Personal emails, her role during the Lebanon crisis)
- Hillary is actually said to be a cold angry person when the camera's are off.
- *Trump said outrages things on TV*, Clinton DID outrages things in real life.
- Trump rally's are said to be crowded by thousands of peoples, while Clinton's rally's were crowded by only a few hundred. The media tried to make it look like Hillary had thousands of supporters, while independent journalists showed the truth.
- Trump is against illegal immigrants, Clinton wanted to invite more illegal immigrants. Why does the USA need MORE illegal immigrants if I might ask? To get a more colored society? To get a more cultured society? To destroy the white establishment? To destroy white ethnic homogeneous society's within the USA? The get more more votes for the democrats (a lot of colored people voted for Hillary... so there is a huge correlation). Do not forget that the USA had a 95% white population around 1950. 
- Trump only had at least one famous person who recommended him in his campaign. Clinton had HUNDREDS of famous persons she needed to get their fans to vote for her. Only dumb people let their choice be influences by their idols. 
- The USA WAS indeed great when it was ruled by white people in the past, but also later by those of other backgrounds. However... some organisations and youth clubs are turning these people with ''other backgrounds'' against white people.
-Trump had many Black, Asian and Latino people supporting him, something the ''media'' wants to keep silent. People of ALL backgrounds want to see the madness going on in the USA stop.

Bernie Sanders gave Democrats a chance to reinvent themselves while addressing the anger he knew existed. The Establishment that included mainstream media never saw it coming although millions of us did. History will show that Bernie and his Revolution was robbed by the political elite. It was obvious that (unlike Bernie) Revolutionaries crossed the floor so as to support a GODZILLA that (in the words of Michael Moore) would destroy it all.

However, this sounds pretty good. If he actually goes through with any of this, I'm pretty sure I'll vote for him in 2020. I wonder how he's going to get it all done, though. The parties have now realigned at the presidential level, the Democrats are the socially liberal pro trade big business party, Rockefeller Republicans, while Trump has tried to turn himself into an anti-abortion Bernie Sanders. But the Republican Congress he'll have to work with is still very conservative, it will take some very nimble navigating to get them to work with a populist. Completing the takeover of the Republican party will be a real test of his deal making skills.

After electing the first non-white president, this is a new milestone on the path to universal excellence.

I'm not happy with the results, but I know I wouldn't have been if Hillary had won either. So, i guess I'll just have to come to terms with it. It is what it is:/ With a heavy heart, I would rather have such a disgusting person as a president than Hillary. Crazy, I know. For many it was kind of like choosing Freedon Vs. Morality. I personally don't agree with many of Hillary's policies, not that I agree with Trump's, but oh well, my values are very far away from Hillary's. This doesn't mean I agree with Trump's racism and what not. :/ A sad, sad day for America😷

I was annoyed by people but I handle myself like a adult real well today cause its not worth saying comments back. I just said well congratulations and that i wish Donald trump the best and that's all I said out of my mouth, its all about being respectful instead of being negative back but with all the negative comments, its very immature. its called grow up, sometimes u just got to grow up and deal with things in life. u understand?",2016-11-09T23:09:34Z,1,1,0,0

He looked like a different man from the one on his campaign trail, and I hope he lives up to his word. As an American, we must accept this man as our new leader and hope for the best.

Also to the people saying the Trump supporter at 9:45 said ""kill Obama,"" i'm pretty sure he said ""repeal Obama.""  Let's not start a flame war over nothing. I hope the rest of my fellow Democrats embrace our new President and at least try to work WITH him and not against him.",2016-11-09T22:58:20Z,1,1,0,0

"Look.
There are so many sore losers.
Trump won, and we probably would have the same feelings about Clinton.
But what you need to realize is that America might not be always agreeing on everything, but we NEED to be one.
Donald J Trump did a great job running for president, doing his part, while Clinton was doing the same. Being the USA president is like being a teacher; you're dedicating yourself and your private space only to help America, and I'm pretty sure not many people knew who Trump was before he ran, and now people (like you) are teasing him, and picking on him, and so forth. Clinton has done the same too, people are laughing at her for losing, and even she wasn't too popular before she ran! We need to realize that with whatever happens, we need to deal with it. We need to support those who win so they can do a good job like the candidate you support. Hurting them and destroying their happiness is NOT going to make America better, it's just going to make it worse! So please, know your limits, you can argue, but be a good sport, and deal with what you have. You can't change this.",2016-11-09T22:57:25Z,-1,0,1,0

At which point, America will be the United States of Europe. These guys are just pawns, and you guys have been played.",2016-11-09T22:26:36Z,1,1,0,0

"How hypocritical liberals & Anti-Trumpers have been. They claim Trump says mean things while they spew hate and vial all day long. They claim Trump is stupid, while they possess a fraction of his IQ and success. They claim Trump is orange haired while they were badly beaten with an ugly stick.

They claim we blindly follow Trump, yet it's obvious they were brainwashed to support harmful & proven corruption. Trump faced only baseless accusations, we determined by real research.

YOU Lefty Liberal or Anti-Trumper, your evil brainwashing and full support of massive corruption almost killed our freedoms and sink the USA!

Really, how did evil trick so many to follow evil Hillary or evil establishment? So many people opposing & hating others just to oppose & hate! It is stupid evil, opposite of tolerance. Shake-off the brainwash.

Possibly try to pull your head out of your corrupt politician’s ass and start thinking for yourself. Then thank God the corruption and brainwashing has been hindered with Trump wining.

All night last night, the US media channels never mentioned the word corruption, or stopping corruption. The rest of world knew Trump was the answer to expose corruption.

"Trump got elected because middle class and lower class white Americans, were tired of feeling like they were the people getting stepped on, kicked to the curb and made to pay for the mistakes of the elite and the minority groups. That is seriously why Trump was elected. He's not a politician. He's not a bureaucrat. He's an ass hole. He's not from inside the political machine. Middle class and lower class white Americans are willing to give that a try. After considering their alternatives.
You have a growing sentiment among these white populations that minority groups say that only these white groups can be racist and to a certain degree, it's true. It's this kind of mentality though that drove Trump to winning the election and these minority groups, special interest groups, lobbying groups, supremacy groups and etc don't seem to get. Trump is an amalgamation of all the hate and ill-will towards DC that has been festering in this country since..... hmm the race riots of the 1980's? Along with the exportation of jobs that began in the 1990's when all the big businesses got together and approved of employer provided health insurance and then skipped town to dodge the bill. Yes, America, I am saying that through bad policy in DC and your hatred and mistrust of each other in the streets, we now have Trump and it's all your damn faults. From the White House to the West Coast.",2016-11-09T21:30:53Z,-1,0,1,0

"The media only lets you see what they want you to see. I found that out 
the hard way in my small town when our local council sent a resolution 
to Senators Boxer and Feinstein protesting the immigration roundups that
 were happening then (8(?) years ago). You might remember there were 
some Cinco de Mayo protests all over the country where the Mexican flag 
was prominently flown. (whenever you raise a flag in a foreign nations 
it means conquest.. the Marines raised the flag in Mexico City during 
the Mex/Amer war). The people of the US must have gotten scared and 
called their congressmen.. hell.. I was pissed. The following year there
 were a bunch of deportations..I tell you this to set up what happened 
to me..

Our council called a ""emergency meeting"" with 24 hr notice via a public 
posting on city hall's bulletin board. When I showed up 3 Mexican tv 
stations were there along with about 200 protesters all holding up 
identical signs (.. looks like they got more notice that me.. a 
citizen!). I got up and spoke in Spanish for 15 minutes against the 
resolution.. all the time the cameras were only about a foot away from 
my face. At the end I asked those to come up and renounce their native 
citizenship and come to the podium and declare they wanted to be an 
American Citizen.. total silence and no one came up. That night I did 
not appear on the 11 o'clock news. Several days later the windows were 
broken out of a business of another who had spoken against the 
resolution.. and all the windows in my house were broken. I called the 
police and they did not come out. It was all for show because months 
later I checked with the Senator's offices and they did not receive the 
resolution.

I might have had an effect because the following year the marches 
displayed the American flag along with the Mexican flag.. just compare 
some of the older You Tube posts and you might catch it. A few months 
after my speech the local Mexican radio stations were mixing in English 
with their normal broadcast and encouraging their listeners to learn 
English.

During those years when I would watch Mexican news.. the first two 
stories were always about some drug related head chopping or gun battle 
that happened in Mexico and that story was always followed by some 
immigration reform news. Whenever the US would come to a critical 
debate, the drug stories would stop until after the debate. Univision 
(Jorge Ramos.. sit down!) and the other News networks are encouraging 
the invasion of the United States and if this were war time. they would 
be guilty of aiding and abetting the enemy. 

Now.. my family has been in the United States for over 100 years. Half 
of us came here illegally but eventually fixed their situation.. but let
 me tell you this. There are basically two kinds of ""immigrants"". The 
first kind comes looking for a new life in this wonderful country.. the 
second kind wants to bring their old way of life with them.

We dodged a bullet this election.. but the forces that empowered Hillary
 are still entrenched... in her speech she gives hint for the others to 
continue the fight. May God help us and Mr. Trump.",2016-11-09T21:27:20Z,1,1,0,0

Trump becomes president elect. Themes of the story. 1) People like crazy drama 2) people are likely to voice what or who they hate through the media than what or who they like. 3) Americans think very differently. 4) You don't have to be always likeable. 5) Is it still a white man's world? 6) Hollywood leans largely democratic.7) Don't get too confident. 8) Every vote really matters. 9) life goes on 10) At the end of the day non of them knows or gives a fuck about you!,2016-11-09T21:11:44Z,1,1,0,0

"I understand that not everyone agrees with who gets elected, that's sort of a given. But the election is over, and there's nothing we can do about it. Too much arguing is going on about who won and it is kind of sad.. If you don't like Trump, quit complaining and try to make a change, without flipping out on someone over the Internet. To make things better we need to unite, not divide. Who knows, maybe it will work out with Trump being president. It's not like he will become a dictator. So in the long run, worry about your local election, rather than the national election, because a person sitting in a chair down in Washington D.C. has much less of an impact than you think. Be proud to be an American, because a whole lot of people wish they could live here, like we do.",2016-11-09T21:10:42Z,-1,0,1,0

"So Trump's speech wasn't half bad :/ but can anyone tell me if I heard right? Trump lists all the things he wants to fix and at 9:47 I think I heard an audience member shout ""KILL OBAMA"". Really?! At a presidential acceptance speech, that is the appropriate time? The correct answer is: Never an appropriate time; but especially not during a humble speech thanking ALL citizens for their support. That is what scares me on a personal level. Not things Trump MIGHT do, but the racism people think is now socially acceptable. An attitude supported because the KKK backed a candidate and that person was voted into office by a majority of US citizens. I want to believe that the levity of the situation is hitting Trump and he will look to less sensationalist speeches/actions. I want to believe that he sees that he is representing US citizens and their mentality to the world and act with honor. But I NEED him to set the record straight on racism so John Smith doesn't start assaulting ""the colored folk for getting too uppity"". I NEED him to be strong about this so black communities don't think they have to riot because the police system/government won't help them. I NEED to know that everyone gets the message because I work in retail and I don't need to be afraid of every stranger that walks up to me.

"When he say: I don't have an explanation for that. That mean:  Obama and Clinton were not listening to people. They were used to do what they want. Same thing for all Country who are shocked by Trump ( people ) victory. Real friendly country are now waiting for new trades and relations with Americans people and not only the Americans gangsters. People had regained power, yesterday, finally. All the third world govs are really scary and they crash. The real friendly Countries are happy and they see a lot of good things in a sane relation with Americans people ( Trump ). Finally, ALL Americans have the opportunity to be themselves and create their own small business, learn a trade in high school without debts, jobs will come simply by these 2 opportunities and many others like Fair trade deal with other Country. Blacks and Hispanics and everyone have the same opportunities starting soon. Today is a day of new openings for People and not only for the Richs and politicians, today is the day of WE the People, Yes today is the last day of the misery as it known in USA for decade of false wars and useless deaths. Today is a day about life and prosperity together as a Country. Rich or Poor, today is the day where you gone finally ask the name of your black neighboor. It is the day where you will have the chance to know your hispanic neighborhood and embrassse all these different nationality who make America so different. USA had start to be great again only if the people make the change for real and start a new of living an open relation with others without fear of the differences. It is the only way to feel safe at home, when you know your neighbor and when we know, we can count on them. today is the day were the herd had transformed into a lot of different persons living together as a whole Country in peace and safety. Don't forget that any homeless persons deserve a hand of help to finally regain their proud as a citizen of USA, they have no voice except yours but they still hope after an infinity, to be back in life again. US citizens had talked yesterday, now it is time to do what you asked for. No "" One Man"" can do it all by himself, a country of persons deserve a Goverment who do what persons are asking for.

"To all Hillary Supporters saying ""You've doomed us all"", etc:

I think the issue you need to realize is that this election wasn't about the PEOPLE running for office, but rather the IDEAS they represented. Few realize that we've just had our 2nd Civil War, but it was one of ideas rather than of physical violence and death. People were tired of being threatened and beaten by criminals and terrorists, and then being called ""racist"" or ""xenophobic"" when they aired these legitimate grievances. They were constantly shown that their own nation did not care about them, and was willing to give everything to foreigners at the expense of the natives, even at the cost of their lives and the lives of their loved ones, and their claims and grievances were constantly shouted down by SJWs and crooked politicians.

Hillary represented every crooked politician at once. She was and still is, every 1984, every Animal Farm, every Brave New World put together. She says she cares for the people but doesn't. Just look at how she abandoned her supporters when it was clear she would lose. If she was in office, there would have been a true WW3, there truly would be an ""American Empire"", and the people would be forced to just sit there and take it as their homes were broken into, their women and children raped, their fathers, sons and brothers murdered. 

Trump represented giving the power back to the people, the idea of the individual's rights to self-sustainability, to financial freedom and not coercion, to self defense and to expect his leaders to defend him against threats both foreign and domestic. 

To put it bluntly: The one everyone said was a war-mongering racist really wasn't a war-mongering racist, and the one everyone said was a good person was actually the REAL war-mongering racist with a rapist pedophile husband who may or may not have raped his own daughter at one point. You can deny that Hillary knowingly and willingly took part in rigging the election, using the media to constantly slander Trump, doing many things that constitute not only treason but crimes against humanity. But denying the truth does not cause it to cease being true.",2016-11-09T19:57:16Z,1,1,0,0

I am 26 years old tomorrow, and I realize that I've got a lot of experiences to have in my life before I can really understand what the Trump supporters believed in. Honestly, I'm excited anyway! Sure Hillary lost, but you know what? This is a democracy.... we vote, and the majority rules, so hey...... 

That being said, I wish Trump the best of luck and congratulate him on uniting the vast majority of the United States, rather than dividing it. So here's to you Donald J. Trump, you won it fair and square and the stage is yours..... you talk a mighty big game with America and what we can do with it.... I just hope you walk an even bigger walk. 

I've realized that when you don't personally know the other side, it's a lot easier to vilify them! I used to think all Trump supporters were fuckin' assholes..... but then I really talked to a few and had a moment of enlightenment......

Both sides have complete, puckered assholes. There's assholes everywhere, but they're not the majority. At the end of the day 
we all want the same thing, don't we? We all want our country to prosper and lead the rest of the world by example. We all want economic growth and happy citizens, don't we? I've met some Hillary supporters that were some real tools..... fingers-in-the-ears tools. Hell, I even found a few Bernie people who I considered to be stupid fucks for choosing to not vote just because he lost out to Clinton. That's dumb. 

We focused on the wrong things; he-said-she-said stupid trivial shit that divided us and pinned us against one-another. So I just kind said ""Fuck it"". We're all here, we all want to same thing..... let's go get it, REGARDLESS of who is at the helm!",2016-11-09T19:46:52Z,-1,0,1,0

America has performed better than expected after the crisis and yet you let yourself be convinced by Trump that you live in hell. I get it, Hillary wasn't the best choice, but you're gonna see with your own eyes what the fuck have you done letting him win. You'll end up like us, with a comedian as president who can only act like a showman (this video is the case) and that will use the presidency for his own benefit. Everyone is and was laughing about Trump, but by the end of four years of Trump I'm sure that no one will be laughing. Say goodbye to your sound economic background and welcome a divided country and welcome the future generation that will grow up with such a man as president.

A feeling of fresh new beginning and that things will change for the better. In lots of ways it did, it was a hell lot better than the 8 years before that(2000-08). But most of us expected alot more change. so here we are again 8 years later and the president elected could be more of the opposite to the out-going president. I can not name one single thing that they have in common. Maybe that a good sign, I mean 8 years ago we have so much expectation for the incoming president yet all our expectation was not really fulfill. Now we have a new incoming president and no one really believe his up for the job, just watch the face expression of all the journalist since trump was announce victorious. So maybe without the expectation that Obama has, trump might just able to pull another rabbit out of his hat as he did with the election.

"This is just such a mess. I don't think that Mr. Trump is experienced enough to be president of the United States of America. He is just a very rich business man. Mrs. Clinton was the wife of a former president. I think she would have done the job a lot better. She is a woman you can trust, even though you know she might have done bad things in the past. She wouldn't do it again. A man who thinks that he can make Mexico pay for a wall between America and Mexico just doesn't seem like a responsible person. And raising taxes for middle class while lowering on the rich, that is madness. I think that this will unfortunately be a disaster. I don't think that insane man deserves any support. Just imagine what is waiting for America in the future, a war? Half the population leave the country? You never know what this inexperienced man might mess up. I don't think he knows how serious and responsible this position actually is. I feel very sorry for the citizens of America.

I've worked in both the oilfield and steel industry since the Democrats held the oval office. I've been laid off in the oilfield and watching the steel industry go the same route because of outside trade deals. Hillary wants to open the market even more which means it'll hurt workers like myself even more. I've been paying 25% more in monthly health payments since the new health program got put into place and will have to pay 2x - 3x more if I get laid off from my job or else face costly penalties. (I paid for them from being laid off last time so I know about them very well)

Judging his track record how could someone believe it? And is it realistic? Of course not, no one is born equal. We can only try the bridge the differences as much as possible.

"Idk Trump is a strange new president.  I don't think he can be truly classified as a Republican, he has some Democratic beliefs as well, and I truly do not think that he s as extreme as he comes off, which is due to both the media and maybe his exaggeration of policies.  I just hope that they do not repeal the marriage equality act and also the wall is probably not gonna be build,just not realistic. But I can not change anything now",2016-11-09T18:07:42Z,1,1,0,0

Despite all of that all of us Clinton supporters need to concede and welcome Mr Trump with open arms. We need to give him a chance because we do not have another option. Fighting, complaining, and rioting will get us nowhere. Although I hated his guts throughout the election I need to keep an open positive mind and have faith that he will do what is best for our country. If all of us Clinton supporters were to be sad and depressed for the next four years then it won't be a happy life. I dream that Clinton and Trump supporters can reconcile their differences.

We need a change and if Clinton would've been president we'd still see the same thing. I understand she has the experence. But she had all the time of those years to change it when Obama was in office. Now we have a man that is the ""Voice"" of the hard working american people that have suffered losing their jobs to other countries. I can say I would rather have Trump as president then someone who has lied about sniper fire in Bosnia, deleted 3200 emails that can or could of put our nation into a huge threat maybe put us in another war. Donald J. Trump is a winner thats his goal. And he won because when he saids he is going to do something he does it. And he did it... People can say whatever they want.

Is he now really president? That can't be true! Let's google. I can't believe. How stupid( sry to the people that voted him) can you be to vote for such an asshole. He's just a LITTLE bit a racist. And you think that we Germans are racists because of 2.WW? Honestly? And if this is written inbad English don't kill me! I just had it 3 years now. And one thing: I think Angela Merkel is great. Think if you would be a refugee. Everyone of your family was killed in the war or on the way out of your country. You have to leave your home and it isn't sure if you will ever see it again. And then there are these stupid countrys that say: No you can't go here. Or some people are like: Eeh you are Muslim you must me part of IS. You just want to have a save and nice place to live.

It could have been Trump or whoever. The Elite forgot its people its workers at industrial areas. It didn't respect its own religion but it did respect Islam and other religions. Now a voice has been heard from the people who were suffering. America needed someone to defend her. Favor its people the American people and then only then help the others coming from abroad. It is simple. If you can help yourself how you help others. I know you will be surprised at the end of the 4 years that indeed it was the best for America.,2016-11-09T17:26:21Z,1,1,0,0

The last 4 years of the Obuma/Clinton era we saw more fracking, more oil pipelines shoved down our throats and placed in the most pristine of areas. We saw/see most of the U.S. being sold to the highest chinese bidder thanks to the ""million dollar citizenship"" OR you bought an aging strip mall (for a million) and now you're a legal U.S.  citizen--not in my eyes.... We saw/see Health care go down the tubes, the shrinking, dwindling middle class who he expected to foot the bill & pay for all the poor and the homeless who don't have health care.All that has caused most middle class to go poor, can't afford healthcare for themselves yet allegedly, make too much to qualify for it!! But you better pay that monthly fee because at the end of the year when you DO finally get to file your taxes, what do you get? Fined thousands because you can't afford your own healthcare. wtf kind of shit is that?! 

   So then you call the IRS to set up a payment plan-otherwise they'll take it all in one chunk out of your paycheck or bank account, you have no recourse or say about it. You owe it according to them so you'll be paying for it. Now your paycheck's short because you had to set up this damn payment plan. See where this is headed?! Pretty soon you sink into the poorhouse. But lucky for you, you'll have healthcare! Nothing else but man, you've got your healthcare. Happy now?",2016-11-09T16:49:58Z,-1,0,1,0

"Okay, I'm sorry that I just have to say this, but I really think this whole election was just very shitty and a disgrace for America!
Neither Clinton nor Trump should have been chosen to run for president. (Why not Bernie Sanders?!? He would have been the best choice!)
To be honsest, I think that Donald Trump will harm the whole world. I think he will start to invate the arabic countires even more and he will bring a lot of war to many countires. And then he doesn't even want to take the refugees? Really?
He is sexist (the way he talks about women and the way he treats them) and egoist (just look what he did with his taxes... So many things could have been improved with this money.), also he is not able to have a real discussion without accusing his opposite to lie, even though they may be talking about real facts. Just take global warming. The whole world is already affected by it and you can see the sings everywhere, but he just denies it. Actually it's sientifically proven, but whatever... 
Talking about pure logic- how is Trump goign to finance the infrastructure and ground forces he wants to send to Syria when he wants to cut down the taxes? (Well, as I told you he will spread war into other countires and still he doesn't want to host the refugees he caused..?)
Also another point is that he wants to prohibit abrotion, which is very unhuman in my eyes.
A woman who has to make a choice like that already has it very difficult and yes, she will have her reasons. And what a woman does with her body and her life is only her choice.
The thing is that there will be a big new black market allowing criminals to make dangerous surgeries on desperated women. The women who don't go to the black market will probably then try to kill the fetus in another way, or she will get the child and loving it only conditionally or maybe give it to a children's home. Also there will be many (very) young mothers who won't have a real chance in life... 
A man who just insults (and discriminates) people for their origin and religion, a man who makes diabled and raped women is supposed to run America and negotiate with other countires which he is just insulting...? 
Really, America I hope you won't regret your choice... Or better- do it!
However, hope is the last thing that dies, right? Or in his case the first...",2016-11-09T16:37:24Z,-1,0,1,0

Did you know at least hat he does NOT BELIEVE ON GLOBAL WARMING?
He claims that alternative sources of energy should be replaced with fossil sources because fossil sources make a higher income!
Then he says that he believes in clean air and clean water, I'll tell you one thing people, this man is a hypocrite and you can't deny it.
So If you have voted him you believe that humans are not spoiling earth and polluting it. If I were you I would feel pretty ashamed.

I'm 16 and come from Italy and it's not that hard to understand that this man is totally racist, sexist, egocentric and doesn't care about our planet. 
If he tries to hide problems like global warming because he is not able to handle them, then how will he be able to improve america's problems?

Meanwhile I work 50-60 hours a week and I'm doing everything I can to be the very best person I could be. Of course, I make a lot more money than she does. She thinks it's ""completely unfair""

She has a degree in psychology that she does nothing with but wave around like some sort of medal. And I've dated those girls who get the art degrees. I don't have a college degree, but I'm about to be a truck driver and make a living that way. I work my TAIL off and it'd almost be INSULTING if these type of people were to make as much money as me

I think the reason the urban areas voted Hillary is because of THESE TYPE OF PEOPLE. I find the kind of person who votes for Trump KNOWS that to rebuild this country your art degree doesn't count for SHIT. We need hard working people doing tough jobs, tough jobs like REBUILDING THIS COUNTRY. I'm ready to help shape this nation back into the great country it used to be

On a last note. He won. She didn't. Now, all we can do is hope he does well. So please, try to keep your whining down. I know you want to, but instead how about we focus our energy into something productive. Like MAKING. AMERICA. GREAT. AGAIN.",2016-11-09T16:29:50Z,1,1,0,0

If you love your neighbor, you will fulfill the requirements of God's law.

"..y'all know what?? Most of you are just caught in your personal feelings without looking at logic and facts...

..people who oppose Trump are like ""he is racist, he is this, he is that!!"" Find someone who doesn't have a racial opinion and make that person 'President of the Universe' - but, of course, no one like that exists..

..people who are for Clinton forget so easily that her family was in charge of handling money that supposed to have gone to the rehabilitation processes for Haiti - every Haitian I've spoken with says that their country is in even more disarray than ever, and NONE gave support for a Clinton presidency..

..now these are just bland examples in light of the obvious, though my point is...were any of you expecting PERFECTION out of this election??? It was a joke to begin with, and Trump provided perfect timing on the punchline..

..he will be an unfamiliar name in politics, period, and I feel this is needed to shake up the system here in the States..that's my logical POV.. I can care less about a personal connection to somebody who's supposed to work towards making life better livable for ALL!! He may not take it personally either and may be looking forward to handling business - rather than hanging out with movie stars and athletes playing basketball while blood spills in the streets..We, as a people, deserve a different option..I'm done with waking up hearing about how much America is behind times in the treatment of regular everyday citizens..

..I'll only say that, Trump, you are being watched for your word..you defied odds..you talked a great talk..and you won!! Congrats, now what???",2016-11-09T15:54:01Z,1,1,0,0

Sure Hillary lost, but you know what? This is a democracy.... we vote, and the majority rules, so hey...... 

That being said, I wish Trump the best of luck and congratulate him on uniting the vast majority of the United States, rather than dividing it. So here's to you Donald J.

"Politicians and the media took to many American Republicans, Democrats, Independents  for granted, good luck they said your job means nothing, global economy get use to it. Compete with slave wages,and country's. Made In the USA doesn't matter anymore. Trade deals, free trade set up for the few. Illegal immigration just except it, If your against it your labeled a racist.  Your morals who cares. Super pacs, superdelegates cheating lobbyist politians  just except it  The media star struck, double standard  often slanted on the hole truth, throw cops and much of the hard working class under the bus. The media treating much of the middle class as no good and dumb, calling them uneducated on one side but never on the other. 
   Americans silent no more, new trade deals a must. No more cheating china and overseas countries and company's on trade to benefit the few but not everyday Americans. Jobs for people of all talents and abilities for Americans not having to compete with slave wages of other countries and many politians and celebrities endorsing  this behavior by the products they make. Then just giving welfare to people to control  them and keep them pacified. A Fair education chance for the working middle class children, for there parents don't go broke. 
  Much of the media now exposed of unequal   reporting on the hole truth, Americans now more than ever not being treated as sheep.
Americans first, fair countries second, cheating unfair countries and companies last.",2016-11-09T15:47:10Z,-1,0,1,0

ahhhhh this was a joke. this election ahhhh so lost all respect for my own country. Donald ahhhh I wish another guy or girl ran for Republican. Because at least then I'd still have respect for Republican. but I have no respect for Donald Trump whatsoever. Even though Mitt Romney wasn't the best choice of Republican. I still had some respect for that guy. women's rights are really important. Without women we'd all die off. There be no more children born. I would never let someone who can't respect their own mother for God's sake even run for president. this election was really a big joke. This is one of the reasons I respect her even more. I've never seen so much violence in an election a day in my life. Trump supporters got out of hand like crazy. I'm really worried because how this election went. I'm just saying for the first time in years. Someone might actually try to assassinate Donald. it's because of all the things that he said. That's how worried this election made me. those are not the best words to use however. that's how much the violence between Democrats and Republicans worried me this year. This really wasn't a good example for an election. no matter who is elected this year. I think it's going to take more of a toll on all of us than anything. this election makes me really worried about the future. this is the two candidates that we have run for president. I don't even want to think about the next election. for Donald to say you have to be rich to be great. it makes me think what about all the kids but I haven't been born yet. About all the people who go through a bunch of crap before they even really find themselves. for someone to say something like that it makes it sound like even though you might be a hard-working American your piece of crap because you're not rich. I don't want to teach children that you have to be rich to be someone. That's not right. we're supposed to be fighting for America here. We're supposed to be fighting for a better tomorrow. I'd rather vote for Hillary. I just don't have any respect for Donald Trump whatsoever after everything he said. I mean he insulted 99  percent of America. I think it's time we have a female president for once. I'd like to see the world change at least a little. I honestly think she's going to win. it just seems so convenient that we've had a black president for the first time and then we have a woman running next. that actually excited me to see that. No offense but I'd rather see a female president this time. that really excited me. I want to see what would happen. I just can't believe this election with the way that it did. all I know is I'm taking my ass to Canada if Trump even wins. I feel like if he wins this would be a really big step back for America. The guy doesn't respect hard-working Americans. He says that you have to be rich to be great. If you're not rich you're not great. You're not rich you're not anybody. That's disrespectful to every single hard-working American and Veteran in the world. I'm worried that if people start losing their houses over economy problems. Donald Trump just going to watch it happen to say sorry if you're not rich you're not great. You're no longer rich and then start making jokes about it. I'm pretty pissed off because this election... Made me feel bad for any Republican that will go through any Financial Devastation in the world. I'm a Democrat for God's sake and at this point in time I'm on both sides. I feel bad for Republicans at the moment because Donald Trump was the best example they have run this year. if anything the Democrats had it really good by having Hillary run for them. sorry Republicans I wish you guys had someone better run. this election just really upset me.,2016-11-09T15:36:16Z,-1,0,1,0

You've fought a long fight and we don't know the motives of the opposition and they have vowed revenge.

"Politicians shouldn't be aloud to give speeches any more. It should all be about what they do. I'm sick of speeches like this. They always say what you want to hear and not only do you not know if it'll actually happen or not but you don't even know if they actually believe in what they are saying and actually have a plan to accomplish it. I'm sick of the smoke and mirrors. Honestly I don't know how much more the people will take it. If they keep talking the future up and never actually even try to accomplish it. Then eventually the people will rise up and throw out the politicians. History has shown that it will always happen if they treat the people poorly and lie to them. Only thing that's not sure is how long it'll take to happen. I will never understand how these people (politicians not talking trump. Yet to be seen what he will do) can treat humans this way. This is are country. Not the politicians or the big corporations. If we wanted we can take everything back at any point. And all this power and money all of you have been hoarding to yourselves will be gone and unfortunately for them they will get what they have given all of us to live off of this whole time. Not even one percent of the scraps. For crying out loud when was the last year that the minimum wage could actually cover the standard cost of living. It's sad when you actually look around. Just pathetic. You can't call yourself the best country on earth with how it's run and how it actually is. We might be better then the others but that isn't good enough when the population majority is poor, hungry, homeless, over worked, under educated and on and on I could go. Being better then a horrible country doesn't make you good. Just not as bad. If you really want America great again then actually start making decisions for humanity and what's right and fair. Not for money or your own political agenda. Be a decent human. Just get rid of all politicians. Literally clean house and reelect intelligent, normal, kind,  honest human beings to office.",2016-11-09T14:06:29Z,1,1,0,0

my biggest concern with this is Trump's level of tact when it comes to certain topics but what I'm most concerned about is Pence and since I'm from Indiana I'm going to just say hope nothing happens to Trump otherwise we'll be left with a fool who seriously damaged a states economy and made us all look like fools. but other than that I hope Trump actually has the common people in heart and mind during his tenure as president and dosent try to throw us to the wolves so to speak and continue widening the gap between the classes and help promote the growth of the already wealthy.,2016-11-09T13:54:11Z,1,1,0,0

"Americans

It's not the end of the world. Trump can't do many of the things he says he can. The only way it's possible is if congress approves it. The wall can't be built with Mexico paying for it. He doesn't have any power over that country. Most of my family is Mexican, but we can't get deported. We're completely legal, and citizens of America. So stop acting like we're gonna get wiped off the map. I wasn't rooting for trump, but he won, and we have to respect that.",2016-11-09T13:35:00Z,-1,0,1,0

NOTHING happens in this world without God's approval.    Trump has the right to be president.  Why not?  God created him for a purpose.  God has guided him throughout his life up to this very hour in America's history.  It could be that he came upon the stage of action during these trying times in our country to make things better because to be honest, the last eight years have been HELL on earth in some ways.  If any black person say that their lives have improved during the present administration's time in the white house they would be lying straight through their teeth.   I just hope that Trump is true to his campaign promise:  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.  I pray that God may bless him richly and guide him because what America really needs now is a REAL man to do exploits and who has the balls to do it.

"well here's to a prosperous 4 years, may everything work in the American people's favor, and this war to end. 

We're stuck with him at least for this long, so we might as well try. he's got a game plan, let's see if he pulls through. he's not interested in war rather he wants to improve relations accross the world, that's more than the other presidents and candidates have said and wanted. let's try and see the good in this, or gracefully watch this country fall. regardless, I'll be paying close attention. I'm sick of the media and being lied too. worst case, he'll just be another president we had. best case he'll serve 8 years and really make this country great in a good way. again we're stuck with him for the next 4 years, so let's try and make this as painless as possible. I'll support him, at least until he screws up. but that's the least I can do. I care about this country, I feel he does too. notice he dosnt mention a wall? instead he talked about rebuilding our highways, and taking care of our troops. to me it sounds like he wants to pull us out of the war, I really look I forward to seeing what he does next.

quit whining people, you don't have to like him, but you do have to accept him. until his term is up at least.",2016-11-09T13:10:31Z,0,0,0,1

"Congratulations to Mr Trump on a fine speech - his delivery was dignified and respectful, he thanked people, talked about national unity, international respect, the American dream, and veterans.  This was such a pleasant change from the loud, aggressive, and occasionally abusive campaign speeches.


However, if you analyse the speech there is very little substance.  For example:
7.25 ""I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans"" - This sounds good but says nothing.  Every president (except during the Civil War) has been a president for all Americans.
9.18 ""Every single American will have the opportunity to realise his or her fullest potential."" - Really? How will this happen?  Obviously not everyone can realise their fullest potential as regards employment, political office, and various other areas of life.  To state the obvious - many people have the potential to become president, but there is only one post available - therefore not everyone can achieve their fullest potential.
9.45 ""We're gonna rebuild our infrastructure ...... and we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it."" - It is not clear if Trump is intending to create new jobs, or if he intends to use the currently employed labour force.

There is one measurable pledge in this speech: - 10.49 ""We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world"".  Unfortunately, Mr Trump does not indicate when he intends this to happen.  Is the starting point for growth to be measured at his inauguration?  Is the doubling to be every year or after 4 years?

On the campaign trail Mr Trump (just like all politicians!) made promises designed to appeal to his audiences - it will be interesting to see how many of these will be carried out when he becomes president.


On a somewhat flippant note: - 6.40 ""Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country"".  The cynical part of me thinks that by ""service to our country"" Trump means being a controversial and flawed candidate who has failed to defeat him.


(p.s. - does anyone know if or when Hillary made or intends to make a public speech conceding defeat?  Her concession by phone was around 4 hours ago as I write this.)",2016-11-09T12:32:19Z,0,0,0,1

Hillary is corrupt and has some ideas for the country but we cannot have someone who is corrupt to be our president.

"""Boohoo my candidate didn't win, I'm leaving the country!"" If everyone who said that after an election actually did it, America would probably be a better place. Trump won because he painted himself as someone who is different from the status quo, speaks his mind freely and honestly. He definitely wasn't my first choice but we have over half a country full of people who are fed up with all the bullshit that has made America a laughing stock for the last decade. If Trump can bring to pass even half of what he has promised then I think I can once again be proud to call myself an American. Also thought it was incredibly rude of Hillary to not even speak to her many voters after conceding the election, talk about a slap in the face. Yeah losing sucks but that's an outcome you have to prepare yourself for when you run for office, just think it's lame that her little feelings are so hurt that she can't even drum up a heart felt thank you in person to the people who supported her.",2016-11-09T12:12:57Z,-1,0,1,0

One thing we can be sure of, however, is that the big money interests will be constantly attempting to regain whatever power and influence they may have lost when Trump was elected.

We the people must be equally relentless in our pursuit of the truth and the defense of our liberties. We need to never be too sure that we really know what the truth is, and we must always defend our freedom as if it is on the verge of being taken away.

and you could tell that she got desperate at the end when she called on all of the Devil Worshipping entertainers to back her up. 
Like Beyonce and Jayz and Lady Gaga she really sealed her fate when she made that move. Who did she think the American people were. Her last days of campaigning was filled with all of these desperate acts. And some of the very people who she had backing her probably thought,  Wow how desperate is this Woman. She will do anything to get in office. 

Donald on the other hand did what a serious minded, level headed Presidential contender should have done, and he really shown brightly coming down the wire.
A lot of People who the Media was trying to stir mess up with the Trump campaign were at the voting booths casting their vote for him.
